{"TextId":82,"Content":"On a clear day you can see for twenty-five miles in all directions because you are in the largest observation wheel ever built. You are sealed into one of the thirty-two capsules with the strangers who were next to you in the queue, and when they close the doors, the sound of the city is cut off. You begin to rise. The capsules are made of glass and steel and are hung from the rim of the wheel. As the wheel turns, the capsules use the force of gravity to stay upright. It takes thirty minutes to go a full circle.","Source":"The London Eye Mystery","Author":"Siobhan Dowd","Contributor":"TI-30x Pro","Locale":"en","Enabled":1,"StarRating":7.61185,"Obscurity":4.6886425,"Density":3.837936,"LengthR":6.859192}
