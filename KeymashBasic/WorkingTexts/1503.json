No more walking 'round with my head down, I'm so over being blue, cryin' over you. And I'm so sick of love songs, so tired of tears. So done with wishin' you were still here. Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow. So why can't I turn off the radio?","Source":"So Sick","Author":"Ne-Yo","Contributor":"kvn#0790","Locale":"en","Enabled":1,"StarRating":8.520877,"Obscurity":4.9943523,"Density":4.9631796,"LengthR":7.1644297}
