{"TextId":1673,"Content":"Proud enough for you to call me arrogant, greedy enough to be labeled a thief. Angry enough for me to go and hurt a man, cruel enough for me to feel no grief. Never could have just a part of it, I always need more to get by. Getting right down to the heart of it, the root of all evil has been running my whole life. Dirty enough for me to lust, leaving nothing left to trust, jealous enough to still feel envious. Lazy enough to sleep all day and let my life just waste away, selfish enough to make you wait for me.","Source":"The Root of All Evil","Author":"Dream Theater","Contributor":"Vielle#4742","Locale":"en","Enabled":1,"StarRating":7.551729,"Obscurity":4.8803635,"Density":3.532735,"LengthR":6.854629}
