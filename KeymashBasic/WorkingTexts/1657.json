{"TextId":1657,"Content":"Now that you can see all you have done. That where there is despair, I may bring hope. That where there are shadows, I may bring light. It's time to take that step into the kingdom. That where there is sadness, I may bring joy. All your sins will help to make you strong. That I may seek rather to comfort, than to be comforted. That I may seek to understand than to be understood. And help you break right through the prison wall. That I may seek to love, rather than to be loved. For it is by self-forgetting that one finds, it is by forgiving that one is forgiven.","Source":"The Shattered Fortress","Author":"Dream Theater","Contributor":"Vielle#4742","Locale":"en","Enabled":1,"StarRating":8.036648,"Obscurity":4.7327213,"Density":4.361003,"LengthR":7.065613}
