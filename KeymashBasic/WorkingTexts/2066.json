{"TextId":2066,"Content":"Do not stand at my grave and weep. I am not there, I do not sleep. I am a thousand winds that blow; I am the diamond glints on the snow. I am the sunlight on ripened grain; I am the gentle autumn's rain. When you awaken in the morning's hush, I am the swift uplifting rush (of quiet birds in circled flight). I am the soft star that shines at night. Do not stand at my grave and cry. I am not there; I did not die.","Source":"Do Not Stand at My Grave and Weep","Author":"Mary Elizabeth Frye","Contributor":"Unknown","Locale":"en","Enabled":1,"StarRating":8.109978,"Obscurity":4.9862404,"Density":5.534849,"LengthR":6.278984}
