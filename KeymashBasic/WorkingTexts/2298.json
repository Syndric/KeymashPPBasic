{"TextId":2298,"Content":"The sky - the genuine sky, not an artificial one - is falling, stopping, falling again, as if grand pieces of a celestial puzzle are being moved and switched by some befuddled god.

The look in her eyes grows colder, her breathing slows, and the faint glimmer of excitement provided by this cataclysmic view is snuffed out, replaced with objectivity. Her opinion on the disaster destroying all is delivered in a single word. With a little appreciation, in a mostly hollow tone, she says, \"Delightful.\" As if the word has any meaning. As if the fall has any meaning. As if the world has any meaning.","Source":"{ Arcaea }","Author":"Lowiro (t+pazolite)","Contributor":"Unknown","Locale":"en","Enabled":1,"StarRating":9.737585,"Obscurity":6.907751,"Density":5.3288565,"LengthR":7.347632}
