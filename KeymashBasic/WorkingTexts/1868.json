{"TextId":1868,"Content":"If you want to know what's behind the show, you ride my carousel and enter life's jail cell. Love and blood begin to meld, you've lost the self that you once held. Merry go round your head - awake, asleep, alive, or dead. The clown that painted a smile on you, is now the one unmasking you. Animated scenes unwind. Dormant figures come to life. Entangled in your own web, a twisted tunnel overhead. A glimpse of light, a drop of dew. You slide into the swimming pool.","Source":"Carousel","Author":"Mr. Bungle","Contributor":"DAMAGED#0384","Locale":"en","Enabled":1,"StarRating":8.646792,"Obscurity":6.788891,"Density":4.390225,"LengthR":6.60717}
