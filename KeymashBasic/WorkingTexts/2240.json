{"TextId":2240,"Content":"White stones border the path. Two dogs are following an old woman in gardening clothes as she strolls along. She is in the middle distance, small beneath the trees, beneath the snowy peaks. It is winter. All the elms are bare. The scene is both stark and comforting. This path leads toward one edge of the camp, but the wire is out of sight, or out of focus. The tiny woman very much seems at ease. She and her tiny dogs seemed swallowed by the landscape, or floating in it.","Source":"Farewell to Manzanar","Author":"Jeanne Wakatsuki Houston & James D.
