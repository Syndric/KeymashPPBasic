{"TextId":1874,"Content":"Vade retro, alter ego; move aside, I'm choking on this life. I think I tolerate your hate, as long as you're afraid. All I wanted was to be with you and suffer every day. Under the moon I hold, a wake for a promise torn. Mortally wounded, feelings sheltered me. Once again my shadow will enter your life. Time to walk with me the last mile! I read a book about a man, a love, a woman, how they died. How I was waved aside, listen how the headless doves cry. I truly see a madman in the mirror when I'm weak. I spent a year in love before I realized it's me!","Source":"Don't Say a Word","Author":"Sonata Arctica","Contributor":"Vielle#4742","Locale":"en","Enabled":1,"StarRating":8.329899,"Obscurity":5.401436,"Density":4.3921537,"LengthR":7.0275574}
