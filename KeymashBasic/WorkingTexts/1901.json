{"TextId":1901,"Content":"When the night meets the day, I'll be watchin' the red sky. Hear the whisper of wind, take a power that never end. History tells a lie: we don't believe in the Darkest Age. Change the time of the gloom; we just fight for the freedom. From the past I'm hearing there is a voice that's calling me. Just feel the fire it's never end. On through the night, we are striding on and on. Hear your voices, spreading your wings and fly away. I just feel your power of the steel, so I'll never die in the heat. I just feel your power of the steel, so I'll never die.","Source":"Whisper in the Red Sky","Author":"Galneryus","Contributor":"Vielle#4742","Locale":"en","Enabled":1,"StarRating":8.128701,"Obscurity":4.5024204,"Density":4.843884,"LengthR":7.0236673}
