{"TextId":2261,"Content":"It happened during the procession at a parish church in Ontario, Canada. As the choir moved in perfect unison to the hymn, the last young lady slipped her stiletto heel into the grating over a hot air duct in the center of the aisle. The first man following her noticed the situation, and without skipping a beat, reached down and swooped up the shoe. The entire grating came with it. Startled, but still singing, the man marched on, carrying in his hand the shoe with the grating attached. There was never a break in the procession and right in time to the beat, the next man fell into the open duct.","Source":"The Organ Portfolio - Musical Memories from a Church Without Walls","Author":"Sarah Rickman and Dorothy Wells","Contributor":"Unknown","Locale":"en","Enabled":1,"StarRating":7.981343,"Obscurity":5.161314,"Density":3.6407537,"LengthR":7.1842055}
