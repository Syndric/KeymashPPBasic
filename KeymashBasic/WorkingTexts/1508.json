Since you didn't wanna give me your math, I thought that you were iggin' me, and wasn't diggin' me. But anyway, what you doing tonight? I'll probably be with my peeps. If it's cool with you, maybe we'll swing by and you can just chill with us, or you can just chill with me. As long as you're comfortable and you feel secure when you're with me.","Source":"Just Friends (Sunny)","Author":"Musiq Soulchild","Contributor":"kvn#0790","Locale":"en","Enabled":1,"StarRating":7.837835,"Obscurity":5.1885433,"Density":4.40606,"LengthR":6.5034027}
