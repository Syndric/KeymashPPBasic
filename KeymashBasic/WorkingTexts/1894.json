{"TextId":1894,"Content":"I try to enter deep inside and devour everything. All I need is power to take control till destroying. To see the light of the seven signs and reach the prophecy. All I feel is anger inside to take control till destroying. To break down till the end. Just hide away into your mind, there is no place for me to die. Call me invincible spy, fear and panic everywhere. You can pass away, I'll keep your soul and all remains. I'm vicious caller, tears and chaos everywhere, end is not so far away.","Source":"Virus","Author":"Heavenly","Contributor":"Vielle#4742","Locale":"en","Enabled":1,"StarRating":8.288157,"Obscurity":5.909025,"Density":4.2703395,"LengthR":6.744486}
