{"TextId":1899,"Content":"Hiding in the fog where darkness meets the moonlight I will sing a melody till the morning comes. Living for you only, take my hand and show me. There will be much sorrow when the morning comes. Fearless I'm fighting the pain burns inside of me; find the forces of my soul. No one can understand me, am I condemned to ride the blackest night alone? Tragic painting on the walls. In this castle where affliction reigns so many died in vain, hear their distant cries. Never again!","Source":"Symphony of the Night","Author":"DragonForce","Contributor":"Vielle#4742","Locale":"en","Enabled":1,"StarRating":8.2456875,"Obscurity":5.837036,"Density":4.3753824,"LengthR":6.6670084}
