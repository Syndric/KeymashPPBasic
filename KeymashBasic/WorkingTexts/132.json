{"TextId":132,"Content":"Making mistakes is part of learning to choose well. No way around it. Choices are thrust upon us, and we don't always get things right. Even postponing or avoiding a decision can become a choice that carries heavy consequences. Mistakes can be painful-sometimes they cause irrevocable harm-but welcome to Earth.

We must rise above such things.","Source":"Keys to the Demon Prison","Author":"Brandon Mull","Contributor":"ClimbingBirdYT#1532","Locale":"en","Enabled":1,"StarRating":8.573243,"Obscurity":6.4520435,"Density":4.4404697,"LengthR":6.6828775}
