{"TextId":1661,"Content":"The smile of dawn, arrived early May, she carried a gift from her home. The night shed a tear to tell her of fear and of sorrow and pain she'll never outgrow. Death is the first dance, eternal. There's no more freedom, the both of you will be confined to this mind. I was told there's a miracle for each day that I try. I was told there's a new love that's born for each one that has died. I was told there'd be no one to call on when I feel alone and afraid. I was told if you dream of the next world. You'll find yourself swimming in a lake of fire.","Source":"Metropolis - Part I: \"The Miracle and the Sleeper\"","Author":"Dream Theater","Contributor":"Vielle#4742","Locale":"en","Enabled":1,"StarRating":7.4467525,"Obscurity":4.272854,"Density":3.6551983,"LengthR":7.003984}
