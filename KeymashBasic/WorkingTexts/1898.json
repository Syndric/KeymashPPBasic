{"TextId":1898,"Content":"Lost in a dream, finally it seems, emptiness and everlasting madness. See the sadness grow, watching as we know, long before our journey for the world. Call for us, the power in all of us. So far beyond the blackened sky tonight. Glorious, forever more in us, we are victorious, and so alive. We'll all find our sacrifice tomorrow, our journey on towards a brighter day. Silent tears we left behind, still so far away, across the endless sands through the fields of our despair. Free for all eternity, we stand. Rise above the universe tonight, Starchaser.","Source":"Heroes of Our Time","Author":"DragonForce","Contributor":"Vielle#4742","Locale":"en","Enabled":1,"StarRating":8.733568,"Obscurity":6.4401703,"Density":4.237238,"LengthR":7.0236673}
