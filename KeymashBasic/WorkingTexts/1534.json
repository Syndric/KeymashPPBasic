{"TextId":1534,"Content":"Easy come, easy go, that's just how you live. Take it all, but you never give. Shoulda known you was trouble from the first kiss. Had your eyes wide open, why were they open? Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash, you tossed it in the trash. To give me all your love is all I ever ask. 'Cause what you don't understand is I'd catch a grenade for ya. Throw my hand on a blade for ya. I'd jump in front of a train for ya. You know I'd do anything for ya. I would go through all this pain, take a bullet straight through my brain. Yes, I would die for ya, baby. But you won't do the same.","Source":"Grenade","Author":"Bruno Mars","Contributor":"kvn#0790","Locale":"en","Enabled":1,"StarRating":8.370469,"Obscurity":4.922638,"Density":4.7079725,"LengthR":7.1710744}
