{"TextId":1885,"Content":"Alone I walk among the twisting shadows, tempted by the ancient magic: the Power of Five. My desire to mirror my own image and I will offer you no soul - offer you no soul. Tonight darkness will shadow the light. Symmetry divine, there's no force greater dividing the Fathers of Time. Feel my hate, I'm banished to this wasteland. My Serpents plot the overthrow of your temples and shrines. In the night, my army's rage and fury burning my shadow into the land, vengeance by my hand.","Source":"Fallen","Author":"Symphony X","Contributor":"Vielle#4742","Locale":"en","Enabled":1,"StarRating":8.83657,"Obscurity":6.5068398,"Density":4.9172225,"LengthR":6.6933517}
