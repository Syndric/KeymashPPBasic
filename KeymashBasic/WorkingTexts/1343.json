{"TextId":1343,"Content":"Thank you, Arnold, for bringing this very serious issue to our attention. Now, people, one of our own classmates is in trouble and it's up to us to help her through her crisis. I think we should all go over to Phoebe's after school and tell her that she has nothing to be embarrassed about. I think we should tell her that we love her and care for her and if she comes back to school, we'll all forget about her little incident and never talk about it again! What do you say?! Okay, if we pull this off, then tomorrow's Movie Day.","Source":"Hey Arnold!","Author":"Craig Bartlett","Contributor":"kvn#0790","Locale":"en","Enabled":1,"StarRating":8.0837555,"Obscurity":4.9595394,"Density":4.4803224,"LengthR":6.916886}
