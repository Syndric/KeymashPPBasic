It's time to take that step into the kingdom. That where there is sadness, I may bring joy. All your sins will help to make you strong. That I may seek rather to comfort, than to be comforted. That I may seek to understand than to be understood. And help you break right through the prison wall. That I may seek to love, rather than to be loved. For it is by self-forgetting that one finds, it is by forgiving that one is forgiven.","author":"Dream Theater","source":"The Shattered Fortress","contributor":"Vielle#4742","locale":"en","enabled":1,"created":1626686151}
