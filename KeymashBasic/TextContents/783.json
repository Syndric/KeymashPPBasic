{"_id":"3rfhqft9soo5KSuzC","textId":783,"content":"Asked about aerodynamics, Reichman emphasized his team's concern for stability, this is a rather fast vehicle after all. This encouraged serious testing to confirm its capabilities, including making use of computational fluid dynamics, a far cry from using tufts of yarn taped to an already-determined form. For a large vehicle, the weight is much less than some of its rivals, in part due to materials choices. The main structure is aluminum, but to avoid the high-stress, high-weight problems of a rear liftgate, the team made the entire frame for the rear opening out of composites and made the lift panel composite, as well.","author":"Robert Cumberford","source":"Automobile Magazine","contributor":"TheDecentDude#8643","locale":"en","enabled":1,"created":1608694829}
