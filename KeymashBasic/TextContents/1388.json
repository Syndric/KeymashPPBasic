I love that love is going to take control of me. When I'm with you, it's for real. What I feel, when I'm with you. When I'm with you, I wonder why people do stop and stare and smile at us. When I'm with you, the sun shines my way. Baby, our love reflects its rays of light on everyone in the world.","author":"Tony Terry","source":"With You","contributor":"kvn#0790","locale":"en","enabled":1,"created":1617403654}
