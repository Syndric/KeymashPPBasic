All I wanted was to be with you and suffer every day. Under the moon I hold, a wake for a promise torn. Mortally wounded, feelings sheltered me. Once again my shadow will enter your life. Time to walk with me the last mile! I read a book about a man, a love, a woman, how they died. How I was waved aside, listen how the headless doves cry. I truly see a madman in the mirror when I'm weak. I spent a year in love before I realized it's me!","author":"Sonata Arctica","source":"Don't Say a Word","contributor":"Vielle#4742","locale":"en","enabled":1,"created":1626686253}
