The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready... start!","source":"FitnessGram PACER Test","author":"The Cooper Institue","contributor":"Unknown","locale":"en","enabled":1,"created":"1646430843"}
