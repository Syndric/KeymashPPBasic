{"_id":"vS9RAWPLECr4DTRdx","textId":97,"content":"Welcome to 'Visions of Nature'. This room has several paintings in it. Some are big, some are small. People did them and they're here now. I believe that after this is over, they'll be hung in government buildings. Why the government is involved in an art show is beyond me. I also think it's pointless for a human to paint scenes of nature when they could just go outside and stand in it. Anyway, please do not misinterpret the fact that I am talking right now as genuine interest in art and attempt to discuss it with me further. End of speech.","author":"Greg Daniels","source":"Parks and Recreation","contributor":"dicey#76","locale":"en","enabled":1,"created":1606656960}
