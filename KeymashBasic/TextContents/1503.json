And I know it makes no sense 'cause you walked out the door. But it's the only way I hear your voice anymore. It's been months and for some reason I just can't get over us. And I'm stronger than this, yeah, enough is enough. No more walking 'round with my head down, I'm so over being blue, cryin' over you. And I'm so sick of love songs, so tired of tears. So done with wishin' you were still here. Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow. So why can't I turn off the radio?","author":"Ne-Yo","source":"So Sick","contributor":"kvn#0790","locale":"en","enabled":1,"created":1626686141}
