Love and blood begin to meld, you've lost the self that you once held. Merry go round your head - awake, asleep, alive, or dead. The clown that painted a smile on you, is now the one unmasking you.

You slide into the swimming pool.","author":"Mr. Bungle","source":"Carousel","contributor":"DAMAGED#0384","locale":"en","enabled":1,"created":1626686253}
