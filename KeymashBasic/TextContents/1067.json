{"_id":"i4C9DHD3Ee3tsfdvg","textId":1067,"content":"The calculus of functions of more than one variable unites the calculus of one variable, which the reader presumably knows, with the theory of vector spaces, and the adequacy of its treatment depends directly on the extent to which vector space theory really is used. The theories of differential equations and differential geometry are similarly based on a mixture of calculus and vector space theory.","author":"Lynn Harold Loomis, Shlomo Sternberg","source":"Advanced Calculus Revised Edition","contributor":"cody#9609","locale":"en","enabled":1,"created":1612768473}
