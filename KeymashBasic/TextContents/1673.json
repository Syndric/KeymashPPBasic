Angry enough for me to go and hurt a man, cruel enough for me to feel no grief. Never could have just a part of it, I always need more to get by.

Lazy enough to sleep all day and let my life just waste away, selfish enough to make you wait for me.","author":"Dream Theater","source":"The Root of All Evil","contributor":"Vielle#4742","locale":"en","enabled":1,"created":1626686152}
