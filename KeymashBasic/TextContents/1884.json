{"_id":"gtW7pgNWPsRzztk56","textId":1884,"content":"What's become of the world, the colors unfurl revealing a blackened haze. Conditioned to fear, the voice that we hear calling the end of days. Millions of souls under control like pawns to a king, led by a string to the final hour. Lords of technology that fell into the void. Oh shall it be as it was before. Tragedy on every shore. Is this the end of all we know. Innocence lost so long ago. Woven in dreams, the darkest of schemes now takes hold of our destiny. Decades of greed, plague, famine and war, we can't go on like this anymore. Living like fools, chaos will rule this eternal paradise.","author":"Symphony X","source":"A Fool's Paradise","contributor":"Vielle#4742","locale":"en","enabled":1,"created":1626686254}
