Prophecies told of a mage of the winter snow, wizard of blizzard, master of ice, wielding magical might. Long long ago, centuries past, he returns with fire and light. Storming through the skies, the stars falling on the night of winterlight. Soaring high above, white fields, frozen on the nights of winterlight. Rise through the ice and a new dawn will arise beyond the night of winterlight.","author":"Twilight Force","source":"Night of Winterlight","contributor":"Vielle#4742","locale":"en","enabled":1,"created":1626686253}
