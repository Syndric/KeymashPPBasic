If I had a diamond heart - oh-oh - you could shoot me with a gun of gold. And if I was unbreakable, I'd walk straight through the bullet, bendin' like a tulip, blue-eyed and foolish - never mind the bruises - into the fire, breakin' through the wires; and give you all I've got. (If I had a diamond heart,) I'd walk straight through the dagger; never break the pattern: diamonds don't shatter, beautiful and battered; into the poison, cry you an ocean, and give you all I've got.","source":"Diamond Heart (ft.
