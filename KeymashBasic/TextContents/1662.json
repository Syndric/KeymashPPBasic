Voices crying in the wilderness, somebody is asking for my help. Rise against! Out loud! Show you my noble action. Win or lose to be proud. I'll prove my devotion. With a rage like a shroud. I'm ready for action, feel my riot of emotion. I only fight in the cause of justice. I am an enemy to injustice.","author":"Galneryus","source":"Enemy to Injustice","contributor":"Vielle#4742","locale":"en","enabled":1,"created":1626686151}
