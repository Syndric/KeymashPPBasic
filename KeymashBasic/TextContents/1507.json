See, I've been watching you for a while and I just gotta let you know that I'm really feeling your style. 'Cause I have to know your name and leave you with my number, and I hope that you would call me someday. If you want, you can give me yours too and if you don't, I ain't mad at you. We can still be cool. I'm not trying to pressure you, just can't stop thinkin' 'bout you. You ain't even really gotta be my girlfriend. I just wanna know your name and maybe we can hook up, hang out, just chill.","author":"Musiq Soulchild","source":"Just Friends (Sunny)","contributor":"kvn#0790","locale":"en","enabled":1,"created":1626686142}
