I wish I could be the perfect daughter, but I come back to the water, no matter how hard I try. Every turn I take, every trail I track, every path I make, every road leads back, to the place I know where I cannot go, where I long to be. See the line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me. And no one knows, how far it goes. If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me, one day I'll know. If I go there's just no telling how far I'll go.","author":"Auliâ€™i Cravalho","source":"How Far I'll Go (Moana)","contributor":"kvn#0790","locale":"en","enabled":1,"created":1626686148}
