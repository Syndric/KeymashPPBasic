You're the castle in the skies. I'm an island on the ocean. Will we make it through the night - if we're guided by devotion? If we drift to the horizon; if we let it all go, then will you come with me - til' we are free? If we drift to the horizon and if we let it all go, then will you come with me? I'm gonna make it somehow; I'm gonna break through the clouds. I will make you mine. I'm gonna sing it out loud; I'm gonna drown in the sun. Will you leave me a sign?","source":"Drifters (ft.
