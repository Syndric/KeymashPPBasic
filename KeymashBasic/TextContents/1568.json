{"_id":"ggMamJ2bPLABDmtAX","textId":1568,"content":"So here's another day I spend away from you. Another night I'm on another broken avenue. My bag is ripped and worn, then again, now so am I. Take what you want to take, what you want to take, what you... I miss the stupid things, we go to sleep and then you wake me up and kick me out of bed at 3 AM. Pick up the phone and hear you saying things to me, do what you want to do, what you want to do, what you. Take me with you, I start to miss you. Take me home, I don't want to be alone tonight. And I do want to show you I will run to you, to you 'til I can't stand on my own anymore.","author":"Marianas Trench","source":"Cross My Heart","contributor":"kvn#0790","locale":"en","enabled":1,"created":1626686145}
