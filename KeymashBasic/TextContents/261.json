Every time you place a book in the hands of a child, you do the same thing. It is very risky. But each time a child opens a book, he pushes open the gate that separates him from Elsewhere. It gives him choices. It gives him freedom. Those are magnificent, wonderfully unsafe things.","author":"Lois Lowry","source":"The Giver","contributor":"Yuki#2193","locale":"en","enabled":1,"created":1608694751}
