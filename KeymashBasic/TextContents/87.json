Over 6,700 hectares/16,750 acres of denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) vineyards fall within the zone and are divided into seven different appellations: Castelli Romani (1,400 hectares of vineyard in the late 1990s); Colli Albani (1,115 hectares), Colli Lanuvini (950 hectares), Frascati (some 2,150 hectares) Marion (1,000 hectares), Montecompari (12 hectares), and Velletri (137 hectares).","author":"Jancis Robinson","source":"The Oxford Companion to Wine","contributor":"dicey#76","locale":"en","enabled":0,"created":1606656960}
