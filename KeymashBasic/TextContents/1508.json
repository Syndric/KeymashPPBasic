Since you didn't wanna give me your math, I thought that you were iggin' me, and wasn't diggin' me. But anyway, what you doing tonight? I'll probably be with my peeps.

As long as you're comfortable and you feel secure when you're with me.","author":"Musiq Soulchild","source":"Just Friends (Sunny)","contributor":"kvn#0790","locale":"en","enabled":1,"created":1626686142}
