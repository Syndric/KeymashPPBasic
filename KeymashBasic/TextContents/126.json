Only so many people can be in our boat, no matter how many swimmers you see bobbing about in the ocean. If you try to pull in too many, you sink. You save nobody, including those who were in the boat. Our priority has to be those who are in the boat, because we can't save all of those who need to be in the boat. Our only exception has been when those on the outside can make our lifeboat stronger and more self-sustaining.","author":"Eric Walters","source":"The Rule of Three","contributor":"ClimbingBirdYT#1532","locale":"en","enabled":1,"created":1607020140}
