You are sealed into one of the thirty-two capsules with the strangers who were next to you in the queue, and when they close the doors, the sound of the city is cut off. You begin to rise.

It takes thirty minutes to go a full circle.","author":"Siobhan Dowd","source":"The London Eye Mystery","contributor":"TI-30x Pro","locale":"en","enabled":1,"created":1601034763}
