I'm in my room, it's a typical Tuesday night. I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like and she'll never know your story like I do. But she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts. She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers dreaming about the day when you wake up and find that what you're looking for has been here the whole time. If you could see that I'm the one who understands you. Been here all along, so, why can't you see? You belong with me.","author":"Taylor Swift","source":"You Belong With Me","contributor":"kvn#0790","locale":"en","enabled":1,"created":1626686144}
