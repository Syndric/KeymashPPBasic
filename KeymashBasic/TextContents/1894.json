To see the light of the seven signs and reach the prophecy. All I feel is anger inside to take control till destroying. To break down till the end.

I'm vicious caller, tears and chaos everywhere, end is not so far away.","author":"Heavenly","source":"Virus","contributor":"Vielle#4742","locale":"en","enabled":1,"created":1626686254}
