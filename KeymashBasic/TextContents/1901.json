History tells a lie: we don't believe in the Darkest Age. Change the time of the gloom; we just fight for the freedom. From the past I'm hearing there is a voice that's calling me. Just feel the fire it's never end. On through the night, we are striding on and on. Hear your voices, spreading your wings and fly away. I just feel your power of the steel, so I'll never die in the heat. I just feel your power of the steel, so I'll never die.","author":"Galneryus","source":"Whisper in the Red Sky","contributor":"Vielle#4742","locale":"en","enabled":1,"created":1626686255}
