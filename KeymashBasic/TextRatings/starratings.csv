2188|The bands of light twisted together to form a comet tail. And then Luma emerged, reborn as a comet. The girl could scarcely believe her eyes. "But... how?" she kept asking. "Our destiny as Lumas is to transform into different things," said a red Luma who had suddenly appeared. "Stars, comets, planets... We can become all of these things!" "When I grow up, I want to become a star that makes someone special smile," said a green Luma. A blue Luma chimed in, "That Luma turned into a real cutie of a comet, didn't he!"|6.765335|8.44154|6.863737
1427|Good morning, Agent P. Dr. Doofenshmirtz is on the move. We tracked him to these coordinates when we suddenly lost his signal. We have two scenarios to explain his disappearance. First, that magical elves have caused Dr. Doofenshmirtz to vanish to the land of angry corn people. The second is that he may be on this secret hideout-shaped island with the initial "D" carved into it, that satellites found at the exact... spot... where... he... vanished... uh. You know what, uh, forget the magical elves thing, way off base with that. Anyway, on your way, Agent P.|8.220608|6.433806|7.0505724
2252|During an SCP-001 event, flowers are observed to spontaneously appear and bloom over 90% of the viable land surface of the planet. These flowers are universally referred to as "vibrant", "bright", "beautiful", and/or words to this effect. The weather will clear, globally, with an ambient temperature recognised as comfortable by the majority of the populace. The global populace will become aware of the fate of the Earth, and of its inevitability. They will also experience heavily decreased levels of violence.

That is the inevitable world of Troy Bolton.

86|Life is a series of decisions. Whether you make the correct decisions or not doesn't matter. The important thing is to keep going forward. Years later, when you look back, perhaps you'll find that the incorrect decisions you made... weren't really incorrect. Similarly, the correct decisions... might not necessarily have been correct. Why struggle with frustration? Why proceed with confusion? In all things... resolution only comes from continuing to move forward. Following this line of reasoning, if there is no such thing as "incorrect," then how can the "correct" exist? Similarly, if there is no "correct," then how can the "incorrect" exist?|6.4513474|7.0567646|7.3264613

Shoot all the blue jays you want, if you can hit 'em, but remember it's a sin to kill a mockingbird." That was the only time I ever heard Atticus say it was a sin to do something, and I asked Miss Maudie about it. "Your father's right," she said. "Mockingbirds don't do one thing except make music for us to enjoy. They don't eat up people's gardens, don't nest in corn cribs, they don't do one thing but sing their hearts out for us.

2182|Suddenly, more Lumas began to pop out from the apricot planet. They were different colors, but they all shouted the same thing. "My mama!" "My mama!" The sight of all the shouting Lumas only made the girl laugh harder. "What am I going to do with all these children?" The Lumas just stared blankly as she doubled over laughing. "I guess we'll have to name each and every one of you."|5.9915504|8.396958|6.052264
2137|My instinct was to say, with contrition: "I'm sorry, sir, I'm not prepared" - a considerable indignity - but in a rare moment of inspiration I decided to concoct a bluff, however lame. Said I: "Well, sir, this case was obviously meant to get us to... but I didn't do any of that. The case said that XYZ Company was in a very competitive industry... there would be no point in charging less than everyone else either. So I figured they should just keep charging what everybody else was charging, and I didn't do any calculations." Ahem. The professor blew his stack.|6.1372604|6.6278787|7.0581226

2298|The sky - the genuine sky, not an artificial one - is falling, stopping, falling again, as if grand pieces of a celestial puzzle are being moved and switched by some befuddled god. And... watching it... her smile begins to gradually recede. The look in her eyes grows colder, her breathing slows, and the faint glimmer of excitement provided by this cataclysmic view is snuffed out, replaced with objectivity. Her opinion on the disaster destroying all is delivered in a single word. With a little appreciation, in a mostly hollow tone, she says, "Delightful." As if the word has any meaning. As if the fall has any meaning. As if the world has any meaning.|6.907751|5.3288565|7.347632

As he watched the lifeless corpse of Zargothrax dissolve into liquid dust, Angus knew that soon he himself would be corrupted by the dark power of that cursed blade. And so he resolved that he must make the final sacrifice for the Glory of Dundee. He would end his own life by descending into the raging volcanic fires of Schiehallion!|8.106106|4.8038645|6.8361926

2086|The QWERTY layout was created around the 1870s when typing was done on typewriters: that old, mechanical device that had a keyboard and directly printed letters onto a piece of paper using ink. The exact reasons for this design are still unclear - many people say the letters are laid out to make the most common keys harder to reach, therefore reducing the risk of jams - others believe the layout was a result of advice given by morse code telegraph operators. Regardless, the QWERTY layout was designed to solve a problem that no longer exists - so the question remains: why do we still use it?|6.975544|5.2194343|7.1710744
2069|Let me explain... You've heard of wishing upon a shooting star? At the "Star Road", your wish is transformed into a star. When it's granted, it then turns into a shooting star and falls down to earth. So you see, the Star Road plays an integral role in granting wishes. But ever since a sword destroyed the "Star Road", everything's come to a halt. No stars have been made since.

21|This beastly predator's aggressive ejection of high-speed projectiles makes it one of the most fearsome creatures in the ecosystem. Its body seems to comprise of both biological and mechanical components, and represents one of the most evolutionarily advanced specimens ever observed. The chamber within its torso gives it rapid-fire bio-pellet launch capabilities. What appears to be a tail fin is in fact the base of its counter-weight and ammunition cylinder, so immobilizing this appendage will prevent the groink from attacking... at least in theory.

Still in wrist manacles, he wandered two miles out of Meridian where he discovered a small animal show and was immediately engaged to wash the camel. He traveled with the show all over Mississippi until his infallible sense of direction told him he was in Abbott County, Alabama, just across the river from Maycomb. He walked the rest of the way.

He played the three-string shamisen, which Kiyo and I called his "pinko-pinko." We would laugh together when we heard him plucking it and whining out Japanese melodies. We would hold our ears and giggle. It was always a great joke between us, except for those rare times when Papa began to weep at the lyrics. Then we would just stare quietly - as I did that night - from some hidden corner of the room. This was always mysterious and incomprehensible.|6.3311844|5.4632077|7.102179

But I finally created a sturdy material that will disappear completely as she does. Your suit can stretch as far as you can, without injuring yourself, and still retain its shape. Virtually indestructible... yet it breathes like Egyptian cotton. As an extra feature, each suit contains a homing device, giving you the precise global location of the wearer at the touch of a button. Well, darling? What do you think?|7.01655|4.670828|7.1710744

They did everything together. You've never seen a kid and a toy more in love. One day, we took a drive, hit a rest stop, had a little playtime. After lunch, Daisy fell asleep. She never came back. Lotso wouldn't give up. It took forever, but we finally made it back to Daisy's. But by then, it was too late. Something changed that day inside Lotso, something snapped.|6.402258|5.546197|6.9757586

I'm not going anywhere. I'm always watching over you, like the sun in the day and the moon in the night." A wave of sadness washed over the girl.

Even a boxer's opponent provides a kind of companionship, someone he can grapple with and grunt at. In tennis you stand face-to-face with the enemy, trade blows with him, but never touch him or talk to him, or anyone else. The rules forbid a tennis player from even talking to his coach while on the court. People sometimes mention the track-and-field runner as a comparably lonely figure, but I have to laugh. At least the runner can feel and smell his opponents. They're inches away. In tennis you're on an island.

Fortunately, there were survivors. 12 nations had operational space stations at the time of the bombs. There is now only the Ark, one station forged from the many. We're told the Earth needs another 100 years to become survivable again. Four more space-locked generations and man can go home, back to the ground. The ground, that's the dream. This is reality.|6.0131207|5.0679884|7.267563
1654|Freedom, calls my name. Serenity, keeps me sane. Happiness, it dulls the pain. Honest, to see my place. Open, to other ways. Willingness, to understand. Justice, but do not judge. Courtesy, for others' flaws. Kindness, it's not that hard. Self-restraint, of tongue and pen. Inventory, my daily friend. Analysis, let down your guard. Look in the mirror, what do you see? The shattered fortress that once bound me.|7.083723|5.6283593|6.265188
1513|Exactly my point! He was the Phantom of the Opera on Broadway. Now my mom, she's seen that musical twenty-seven times. And she put Michael Crawford's picture in our refrigerator. Yeah, not on it, in it. So my point is, if you play basketball, you're gonna end up on a cereal box. If you sing in musicals, you're gonna end up in my mom's refrigerator.|7.9707394|5.5196605|5.7780075
2199|We are taught not to gamble. Perhaps it is thought we have lost enough already: legs, vision, speech, the typical use of our bodies. Others' fears would teach us to cringe at any thought of any risk. Disability and risk don't mix. Risk is something we are supposed to be protected from - by agencies, by professionals - by parents, by doctors - by invisibility, by shame - by confinement if necessary. We must be kept safe: This is one of the lies which fills the beds of the so-called "homes." So we embrace the risks to fight the lies.|5.80315|5.7309995|6.9467335

2183|She remembered rubbing the sleep out of her eyes as she followed her father up that hill to look at the stars... she remembered having picnics with her mother on that hill on bright and windy days... and... "I want to go home! I want to go home right now!" The girl burst into tears, and the Lumas didn't know what to do. The girl was shouting now, her face wet with tears. "But I know she's not there! I knew all along that she wasn't out there in the sky! Because... because... she's sleeping under the tree on the hill!" The girl's cries echoed through the stars, and a hush fell over the area.|4.473854|6.640498|7.1710744
783|Asked about aerodynamics, Reichman emphasized his team's concern for stability, this is a rather fast vehicle after all. This encouraged serious testing to confirm its capabilities, including making use of computational fluid dynamics, a far cry from using tufts of yarn taped to an already-determined form. For a large vehicle, the weight is much less than some of its rivals, in part due to materials choices. The main structure is aluminum, but to avoid the high-stress, high-weight problems of a rear liftgate, the team made the entire frame for the rear opening out of composites and made the lift panel composite, as well.|7.283777|3.7560527|7.267563
2281|The bottom line? Today's organic farming practices are probably best deployed in fruit and vegetable farms, where growing nutrition (not just bulk calories) is the primary goal.

1439|I trusted you, Nicky. I welcomed you into my home. We broke bread together. Grandmama made you a cannoli. And how did you repay my generosity? With a rug, made from the butt of a skunk. A skunk butt rug. You disrespected me. You disrespected my Grandmama, whom I buried in that skunk butt rug. I told you never to show your face here again, but here you are, snooping around with this... What are you, a performer? What's with the costume?|6.942131|5.2394805|6.4424496

2204|Use why-how laddering to flesh out varying user needs and find a middle ground that's both meaningful and actionable.

Would you say that of our fallen comrades? Their lives, were they meaningless? No, they weren't! It's us who gives meaning to our fallen comrade's lives! We die trusting the living who follow to find meaning in our lives! That is the sole method in which we can rebel against this cruel world!|6.622751|5.0993066|6.596005

2152|Well son, I'll tell you: life for me ain't been no crystal stair. It's had tacks in it, and splinters, and boards torn up, and places with no carpet on the floor - bare. But all the time I'se been a-climbin' on, and reachin' landin's, and turnin' corners, and sometimes goin' in the dark where there ain't been no light. So boy, don't you turn back.

To focus on this multitrack processing, one information-processing model, connectionism, views memories as products of interconnected neural networks.

And there's something you shoot through, and all of a sudden, as though you whip a sheet off you when you're asleep, and you're looking into blackness, into black ugliness. And you look down.

412|This is the story of a man named Stanley. Stanley worked for a company in a big building where he was Employee 427. Employee 427's job was simple: he sat at his desk in Room 427 and he pushed buttons on a keyboard. Orders came to him through a monitor on his desk, telling him what buttons to push, how long to push them, and in what order. This is what Employee 427 did every day of every month of every year, and although others may have considered it soul rending, Stanley relished every moment that the orders came in, as though he had been made exactly for this job.

I am your hunter, I'll capture you for all the disaster and pain, you brought to this world. Hate raising up, my heart is burning for. These wounds that will not heal.

Millions of souls under control like pawns to a king, led by a string to the final hour. Lords of technology that fell into the void. Oh shall it be as it was before. Tragedy on every shore.

But now, tonight, the dead were risen, Earth was reinhabited, memory awoke, a million names were spoken: What was so-and-so doing tonight on Earth? What about this one and that one? The people on the porches glanced sidewise at each other's faces. At nine o'clock Earth seemed to explode, catch fire, and burn.

I have lost the minutes and hours. And every so often I will see it again: Light - true light - in the distance. Perhaps it has been guiding me. I wouldn't admit this, to anyone. It's like a loss: relinquishing myself to what I've long criticized. However, I feel it for certain: that light is now beckoning me. That light of the old world is shining, and wants me.

I am not a chip in a card game to be mindlessly tossed into the center of the pot, nor one to be kept in the tight fist of a greedy opponent.

215|It's no accident, I think, that tennis uses the language of life. Advantage, service, fault, break, love, the basic elements of tennis are those of everyday existence, because every match is a life in miniature. Even the structure of tennis, the way the pieces fit inside one another like Russian nesting dolls, mimics the structure of our days. Points become games become sets become tournaments, and it's all so tightly connected that any point can become the turning point. It reminds me of the way seconds become minutes become hours, and any hour can be our finest. Or darkest. It's our choice.|6.376047|3.8527386|7.177666

"But it would be nice to return home once every one hundred years to nap in my favorite sleeping nook." The comet carrying the Lumas and the girl continues on its journey to this very day.

2094|I continued getting better every day - after two weeks, I got my first 100 words per minute score. After a month, my first average of a hundred. I was feeling good: my improvement was consistent, and at this rate, I'd be catching up to my QWERTY speed soon. But improving at typing is not a linear process: even though I was getting better every day, after you reach a certain skill level, your improvement rate starts to slow down, just like any other skill.

Oh, who would ever want to be King! I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing; Roman Cavalry choirs are singing. Be my mirror, my sword, my shield - my missionaries in a foreign field.

2212|Your body does not eliminate poisons by knowing their names. To try to control fear or depression or boredom by calling them names is to resort to superstition of trust in curses and invocations. It is so easy to see why this does not work.

Even postponing or avoiding a decision can become a choice that carries heavy consequences. Mistakes can be painful-sometimes they cause irrevocable harm-but welcome to Earth.

When their only experience of humanity was a crowbar coming at them down a steel corridor. When I plucked her from Black Mesa I acted in the face of objections that she was a mere child and of no practical use to anyone.

1546|Physical wounds will definitely bleed and may look painful but over time they heal by themselves and if you apply medicine, they will heal faster. What's troublesome are wounds of the heart. Nothing is harder to heal. They're a bit different from physical injuries. You can't apply medicine for one thing and sometimes, they never heal. There's only one cure for a wound of the heart. It's a bit bothersome and you can only receive it from someone else. What is it? Love.|6.1224194|4.3225555|6.6292343
2121|When the violins drew out the first strain of the Pilgrim's chorus, my Aunt Georgiana clutched my coat-sleeve. Then it was that I first realized that for her this singing of basses and stinging frenzy of lighter strings broke a silence of thirty years, the inconceivable silence of the plains. With the battle between the two motifs, with the bitter frenzy of the Venusberg theme and its ripping of strings, came to me an overwhelming sense of the waste and wear we are so powerless to combat.|6.449541|3.821491|6.744486
1507|I know this might seem strange, but let me know if I'm out of order for stepping to you this way. See, I've been watching you for a while and I just gotta let you know that I'm really feeling your style. 'Cause I have to know your name and leave you with my number, and I hope that you would call me someday. If you want, you can give me yours too and if you don't, I ain't mad at you. We can still be cool. I'm not trying to pressure you, just can't stop thinkin' 'bout you. You ain't even really gotta be my girlfriend. I just wanna know your name and maybe we can hook up, hang out, just chill.|5.3369865|4.2071705|7.1710744
1837|Of course. Why else would one keep one's ancestors around? You think a man designed the first Guild ship? Your history books told you it was Aurelius Venport? They lied. It was his mistress, Norma. She gave him the design along with five children. He thought his ego would take no less. In the end, the knowledge that he had not really fulfilled his own image, that was what destroyed him.|5.9747696|5.3149695|6.0983624

2263|This church had no walls, no ceiling, no altar, no stained glass windows. Granite outcroppings and boulders served as walls; tall pines were the support beams. The ceiling was the deep blue sky that canopied the highest ridge, the tallest tree. Instead of richly colored stained glass windows, we looked out on pine-covered ridges mounting one after another, each one higher, as if to touch the still hidden snowcaps we knew to be just beyond our line of vision.|6.907646|3.6227665|6.5790896
2211|So many questions, but I'm talking to myself; I know that you can't hear me anymore. So much to tell you, and most of all, goodbye, but I know that you can't hear me anymore. The longer I stand here, the louder the silence. I know that you're gone, but sometimes I swear that I hear your voice when the wind blows; so I talk to the shadows, hoping you might be listening 'cause I want you to know: "It's so loud inside my head, with words that I should've said, and as I drown in my regrets, I can't take back the words I never said."|4.838663|5.03659|6.934044
1662|Yes, I am a soldier, promise I'll always fight in the cause of justice. But I don't do it by order, I'm always an enemy to injustice. Voices crying in the wilderness, somebody is asking for my help. Rise against! Out loud! Show you my noble action. Win or lose to be proud. I'll prove my devotion. With a rage like a shroud. I'm ready for action, feel my riot of emotion. I only fight in the cause of justice. I am an enemy to injustice.|5.624817|5.0732703|6.429964
116|For several days ensuing, her name was unmentioned by either Usher or myself: and during this period I was busied in earnest endeavours to alleviate the melancholy of my friend. We painted and read together; or I listened, as if in a dream, to the wild improvisations of his speaking guitar. And thus, as a closer and still intimacy admitted me more unreservedly into the recesses of his spirit, the more bitterly did I perceive the futility of all attempt at cheering a mind from which darkness, as if an inherent positive quality, poured forth upon all objects of the moral and physical universe, in one unceasing radiation of gloom.|6.210472|3.1267989|7.287747

All I feel is anger inside to take control till destroying. To break down till the end. Just hide away into your mind, there is no place for me to die.

I'll turn him into a flea, a harmless, little flea, and then I'll put that flea in a box, and then I'll put that box inside of another box, and then I'll mail that box to myself, and when it arrives... I'll smash it with a hammer! It's brilliant, brilliant, brilliant, I tell you! Genius, I say! Or, to save on postage, I'll just poison him with this.|5.423765|5.797995|6.0754514

1653|Without love, without truth, there can be no turning back. Without faith, without hope, there can be no peace of mind. As the night went on, I started to find my way. I learned about a tragedy, a mystery still today. I tried to get more answers, but he said, "You're on your own". Then he turned away and left me as I stood there all alone.

Alright?|5.6852417|7.2549596|4.990428
1182|You're too good to feel this bad about yourself. I know that, and you should know that. You have true courage and a big heart. I've seen you get knocked down so many times before, and every single time, you get up again. That's real strength. And... and you're ten times funnier than any human I know. See? See, you know you're amazing. You're smart, and fast, and beautiful. Rayla, you're the most amazing person I've ever met.|5.546175|5.16085|6.37253
1443|Wait, listen! I... I know you'll never forgive me. And I don't blame you. I wouldn't forgive me either. I was ignorant and irresponsible and small-minded. But predators shouldn't suffer because of my mistakes. I have to fix this, but I can't do it without you. And after we're done... you can hate me. And that'll be fine, because I was a horrible friend, and I hurt you, and you- and you can walk away knowing that you were right all along. I really am just a dumb bunny.|5.225977|5.047953|6.634695

However, for those select few who possess the predisposition, I can teach you how to bewitch the mind and ensnare the senses. I can tell you how to bottle fame, brew glory, and even put a stopper in death.

170|I stood on tiptoe, hastily looked around once more, reached into the hole, and withdrew two pieces of chewing gum minus their outer wrappers. My first impulse was to get it into my mouth as quickly as possible, but I remembered where I was. I ran home, and on our front porch I examined my loot. The gum looked fresh. I sniffed it and it smelled all right. I licked it and waited for a while. When I did not die I crammed it into my mouth: Wrigley's Double-Mint.|6.152525|4.2187843|6.5790896

Fearless I'm fighting the pain burns inside of me; find the forces of my soul. No one can understand me, am I condemned to ride the blackest night alone? Tragic painting on the walls.

Show respect for those in power, but don't follow them blindly. Judge with logic and reason, but comment not. Consider none your superior whatever their rank or station in life. Treat all fairly, or they will seek revenge. Be careful with your money. Hold fast to your beliefs and others will listen.|5.9203415|4.631597|6.4424496

I believe that after this is over, they'll be hung in government buildings. Why the government is involved in an art show is beyond me. I also think it's pointless for a human to paint scenes of nature when they could just go outside and stand in it.

Data behind my heart's encryption key - listen and you might hear a melody. Your fire sparked the passion that keeps burning: magic that helps me to believe.

I conjure up the fragrance of Ponderosa pine. I feel the mountain wind stirring my hair. And in my mind's eye I see the faces of the friends of my youth.

Change the time of the gloom; we just fight for the freedom. From the past I'm hearing there is a voice that's calling me. Just feel the fire it's never end. On through the night, we are striding on and on. Hear your voices, spreading your wings and fly away. I just feel your power of the steel, so I'll never die in the heat. I just feel your power of the steel, so I'll never die.|4.5024204|4.843884|7.0236673
2043|It's all right. You won't be alone. You have Bolt. I've altered him. (Bolt is being experimented on to make him stronger, faster, and more powerful, unlike any other dog. A lightning bolt appears on his flank.) He can protect you now.|6.2520313|7.258553|4.4693613
1614|I know everybody on this island seems so happy on this island. Everything is by design. I know everybody on this island has a role on this island. So maybe I can roll with mine. I can lead with pride, I can make us strong, I'll be satisfied if I play along. But, the voice inside sings a different song, what is wrong with me? See the light as it shines on the sea? It's blinding. But no one knows, how deep it goes. And it seems like it's calling out to me, so come find me, and let me know. What's beyond that line, will I cross that line?|4.8998795|4.552734|6.9634185
2100|In the metaphysics of identity, the ship of Theseus is a thought experiment that raises the question of whether an object that has had all of its components replaced remains fundamentally the same object. The concept is one of the oldest in Western philosophy, having been discussed by Heraclitus and Plato by 500 - 400 BC.|6.4903374|5.32264|5.5251274
1530|In my first go at life, I was a healer... Exactly as the name implies, I revive and heal the injured. However, there was a fatal drawback to healing. I see all the experiences of the people I heal stream in front of me in an instant. There was unimaginable fear and suffering, things that couldn't be endured with a sane mind. Truthfully, I ran away countless times because I didn't want to use my healing powers. But no matter how many times I escaped, I always ended up getting caught again.|5.798237|4.027122|6.744486
2009|After much choking, during which his various chins turned purple, he managed to get out: 'If you have your lower animals to contend with,' he said, 'we have our lower classes!' This bon mot set the table in a roar; and Mr Pilkington once again congratulated the pigs on the low rations, the long working-hours and the general absence of pampering which he had observed on Animal Farm.|5.6971016|5.2217813|6.0600243
2217|Listen to me, Woodrow. When a soldier goes into war he must go believing he is never coming back. This is why the Japanese are such courageous warriors. They are prepared to die. They expect nothing else. But to do that, you must believe in what you're fighting for. If you are not willing to die, you won't fight well. And if you don't fight well you will probably be killed stupidly, for the wrong reason, and unheroically.|5.9241047|4.5315375|6.3529224

1897|Ride from the mountains and rise from the seas. Steel of the warriors, you bow to your knees. Sail through the darkness, the true prophecy. Cursed is the night in the sea of dreams. A blaze of light beyond the eastern sky. The stairs of doom towards the ivory tower. A vengeful death that waits for all this time. The judgement has passed, we all now die. A mess of torment for a thousand souls. The unseen fury of the ancient scrolls. The years of torture that have been foretold. A lifetime of fear, they now behold.|5.6981087|3.9203684|6.863737
2066|Do not stand at my grave and weep. I am not there, I do not sleep. I am a thousand winds that blow; I am the diamond glints on the snow. I am the sunlight on ripened grain; I am the gentle autumn's rain. When you awaken in the morning's hush, I am the swift uplifting rush (of quiet birds in circled flight). I am the soft star that shines at night. Do not stand at my grave and cry. I am not there; I did not die.|4.9862404|5.534849|6.278984
2193|I watched her for a moment and she said he was sure he couldn't pay more than seventeen fifty for that china. She reached into the red velvet case, took out a dinner plate and hurled it at the floor right in front of his feet... Mama took out another dinner plate and hurled it at the floor, then another and another, never moving, never opening her mouth, just quivering and glaring at the retreating dealer, with tears streaming down her cheeks... When he was gone she stood there smashing cups and bowls and platters until the whole set lay in scattered blue and white fragments across the wooden floor.|5.3949814|3.6554396|7.200328
2332|If you can get 1% better each day for one year, you'll end up 37 times better by the time you're done. Conversely, if you get 1% worse each day for one year, you'll decline nearly down to zero. What starts as a small win or a minor setback accumulates into something much more.|6.2141724|6.3502626|5.0262556
1674|All wound up, on the edge, terrified, sleep disturbed, restless mind, petrified. Bouts of fear permeate all I see, heightening nervousness threatens me. I am paralyzed, so afraid to die. Caught off guard, warning signs never show. Tension strikes, choking me, worries grow.|8.51985|4.197066|4.9783897
2278|Mr. Peters straightened his tie self-consciously and when Irma handed him a menu, he gestured with it so that the two women at the next table would notice the diamond ring on the fourth finger of his right hand. Both of these things, and also the fact that his hands showed signs of the manicurist, one can blame on the young man who had his picture taken with a derby hat on the back of his head. The young man had never for one second deserted Mr. Peters. He was always there, tugging at Mr. Peters' elbow, making him do things that were not becoming of a man of forty-five.|4.895611|4.267867|7.098588
267|The roots will heal in time... as will the entire world. The sacrifices have been made. Just as the orcs, humans, and night elves discarded their old hatreds and stood united against a common foe, so did nature herself rise up to banish the Shadow forever. As for me, I came back to ensure that there would be a future, to teach the world that it no longer needed Guardians. The hope for future generations has always resided in mortal hands. And now that my task is done, I will take my place amongst the legends of the past.|5.3644753|4.135753|6.8994517
1343|Thank you, Arnold, for bringing this very serious issue to our attention. Now, people, one of our own classmates is in trouble and it's up to us to help her through her crisis. I think we should all go over to Phoebe's after school and tell her that she has nothing to be embarrassed about. I think we should tell her that we love her and care for her and if she comes back to school, we'll all forget about her little incident and never talk about it again! What do you say?! Okay, if we pull this off, then tomorrow's Movie Day.|4.9595394|4.4803224|6.916886
953|Some care is needed in using Descartes' argument. "I think, therefore I am" says rather more than is strictly certain. It might seem as though we are quite sure of being the same person to-day as we were yesterday, and this is no doubt true in some sense. But the real Self is as hard to arrive at as the real table, and does not seem to have that absolute, convincing certainty that belongs to particular experiences.|5.3524|5.0712204|6.3062468
1876|Strawberry blonde, your stranglehold on my heart is bound to end. I suppose, life sometimes, it doesn't go the way it was meant. Though you never were a believer, I assure you - I won't die before you. You read the book now, the part: Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. Short is the fight of this little starling. Love sounds familiar, but the emotion escapes me. I will carpe the diem while it's still here. And see how the fear of death becomes her.|5.7240467|4.417891|6.4853716
1537|I've made mistakes. I could have treated you better. I let you get away. There goes my happily ever after. Tell me why, why can't we try and start again? This can't be how our story ends. You're more than my girl, you're my best friend. Tell me you remember when, when I was your man and you were my girl. It was you and me against the world. Baby, ain't nobody gonna love me like the way you do and you ain't never gonna find a love like mine. Tell me what can I do to make it up to you? 'Cause what we got's too good to say goodbye.|4.840555|4.5331316|6.934044
1604|Maui. When he stole from the Mother Island, darkness fell. Te Ka awoke. Monsters lurked and boats stopped coming back. To protect our people, the ancient chiefs forbid voyaging.

54|When the comet last came, my grandfather, Fire Lord Sozin, used it to wipe out the Air Nomads. Now, I will use its power to end the Earth Kingdom... permanently. From our airships, we will rain fire over their lands, a fire that will destroy everything; and out of the ashes, a new world will be born, a world in which all the lands are Fire Nation and I am the supreme ruler of everything!|5.3770695|5.3330336|6.105939
1624|Yeah, yeah. I'm fine, Buzz. Okay. Here's your list of things to do while I'm gone: batteries need to be changed. Toys at the bottom of the chest need to be rotated.

1896|From the dark, we walk to the light. From the shadows we learn to survive. When there's nothing to hide we will find what comes next after light. Destroy, rebuild, now, now, destroy, rebuild, now, now. I hear the angels sing but I hear the demons louder. Destruction chasing me, pulling me under. Pulling me under now, I'm dying to get out. We will never be the same again. From the dark we walk to the light from the shadows we learn to survive when there's nothing to hide we will find what comes next after light.|5.2371826|4.218457|6.854629
2276|The history book, which he propped against the catsup and the glass sugar bowl, had been used by others before him. Blank pages front and back were filled in with maps, drawings, dates, comic cartoons, and organs of the body; also with names and messages no longer clear and never absolutely legible. On nearly every other page there was some marginal notation, either in ink or in very hard pencil. And unless someone had upset a glass of water, the marks on page 177 were from tears.|5.9682846|3.752546|6.7037425
1657|Now that you can see all you have done. That where there is despair, I may bring hope. That where there are shadows, I may bring light. It's time to take that step into the kingdom. That where there is sadness, I may bring joy. All your sins will help to make you strong. That I may seek rather to comfort, than to be comforted. That I may seek to understand than to be understood. And help you break right through the prison wall. That I may seek to love, rather than to be loved. For it is by self-forgetting that one finds, it is by forgiving that one is forgiven.|4.7327213|4.361003|7.065613
2277|Time is probably no more unkind to sporting characters than it is to other people, but physical decay unsustained by respectability is somehow more noticeable. Mr. Peters' hair was turning gray and his scalp showed through on top. He had lost weight also; he no longer filled out his clothes the way he used to. His color was poor, and the flower had disappeared from his buttonhole. In its place was an American Legion button.|6.155554|4.1116276|6.36602
1790|Just a heads up: we're gonna have a superconductor turned up full blast and pointed at you for the duration of this next test. I'll be honest, we're throwing science at the wall here to see what sticks. No idea what it'll do. Probably nothing. Best-case scenario, you might get some superpowers.

902|If your enemy is secure at all points, be prepared for him. If he is in superior strength, evade him. If your opponent is temperamental, seek to irritate him. Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant. If he is taking his ease, give him no rest. If his forces are united, separate them. If sovereign and subject are in accord, put division between them.

2268|Even in a book of lies sometimes you find truth. There is indeed a season for all things and now that I see you flesh-to-flesh and blood-to-blood I know I cannot raise my hand against you. But know this, you are my greatest disappointment. Does your master hear me? Atlas! You can kill me, but you will never have my city. My strength is not in steel and fire, that is what the parasites will never understand. A season for all things!

1783|Good news is, the lab boys say the symptoms of asbestos poisoning show a median latency of forty-four point six years. So if you're thirty or older, you're laughing.

1111|I was confronted by a world that I could see and touch but didn't know how to talk about. There were so many words and names that I just didn't have. Flowers, trees, birds, reptiles, organs. The words you learn as you grow up in a country the ones the language reserves for people who are immersed in it and denies to those who just dip their toes in every now and then. The words for Saturday-afternoon strolls and summer camps and weekends in the country. Words from peaceful lives, lives that belong to the people living them.|5.432329|3.8596363|6.9125533

2402|The shift in our relationship to the natural world is startling, even in settings that one would assume are devoted to nature. Not that long ago, summer camp was a place where you camped, hiked in the woods, learned about plants and animals, or told firelight stories about ghosts or mountain lions. As likely as not today, "summer camp" is a weight-loss camp, or a computer camp.|5.809326|4.906854|6.0287976
109|Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the western spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small disregarded yellow sun. Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-two million miles is an utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose ape-descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea.|7.316988|3.5251665|5.9810133
2377|Who are we, anyway? The majority? Is that the answer? The majority is always holy, is it now? Always, always; just never wrong for one little insignificant tiny moment, is it? Never ever wrong in ten million years? He thought: What is this majority and who are in it? And what do they think and how did they get that way and will they ever change and how the devil did I get caught in this rotten majority?|4.9836674|5.383713|6.223134
2261|It happened during the procession at a parish church in Ontario, Canada. As the choir moved in perfect unison to the hymn, the last young lady slipped her stiletto heel into the grating over a hot air duct in the center of the aisle. The first man following her noticed the situation, and without skipping a beat, reached down and swooped up the shoe. The entire grating came with it. Startled, but still singing, the man marched on, carrying in his hand the shoe with the grating attached. There was never a break in the procession and right in time to the beat, the next man fell into the open duct.|5.161314|3.6407537|7.1842055

244|Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything - all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure - these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.|5.380451|4.047177|6.798425
1842|Yes! It is I who is onto you, Old Carl. No one is smarter than the Computer Master! I'm always watching, and I'm always thinking. My brain is much larger than Cheryl's brain. She was a fool for letting me go. But now, I will have my ultimate revenge!|6.5159874|6.3431444|4.6878204
2202|This is our gamble: minute by minute, city after city, from the tense beginning to the jubilant or scattered end of every protest, with every rhythmic word of every chant, at each blocked entrance, each barricade, with every defiant inch forward, every move toward freedom for our people, any time we raise a fist or a song to mean we're never going away, in every confrontation, up and down the length of the stand-off, each and every time, we are testing the humanity of people who wear a badge, carry a gun, and fear our incomprehensible strength.|6.0226192|3.0977337|7
2403|Our society is teaching young people to avoid direct experience in nature. That lesson is delivered in schools, families, even organizations devoted to the outdoors, and codified into the legal and regulatory structures of many of our communities. Our institutions... unconsciously associate nature with doom - while disassociating the outdoors from joy and solitude.|6.90823|3.972196|5.9237986

2282|According to one theory, the wisdom of the crowd still holds - measuring the aggregate of people's opinions produces a stable, reliable value. Skeptics, however, argue that people's opinions are easily swayed by those of others. So nudging a crowd early on by presenting contrary opinions - for example, exposing them to some very good or very bad attitudes - will steer the crowd in a different direction.|6.38278|3.9946275|6.223134

1567|For as long as I could remember, I've done everything in my power to live a productive life that allows me to pursue a lasting inner peace. This may be a foreign concept, but I choose not to concern myself with winning or losing, life's troubles, or enemies who bring sleepless nights. That is how I cope with this backwards life we find ourselves living. It's what brings me happiness in a world fraught with hardship and misery. Of course, if I were ever to engage in combat, I would win the battle without question.|5.7438526|3.5598588|6.863737

In the moment, we're lost and found. I just wanna be by your side. If these wings could fly! Oh, curse these walls. In the moment, we're ten feet tall; and how you told me after it all, we'd remember tonight - for the rest of our lives. If these wings could fly...|4.586897|5.2886305|6.460992
2092|There are two things that you have to achieve before you can start getting to respectable speeds. First, know the locations of the keys by memory. I'm talking about not looking at your keyboard or any other reference image while you're typing. You should be able to remember the general location of every key after a moment of thought. Second, know the locations of the keys without having to think about it. This means committing the locations of the keys to muscle memory. You shouldn't have to actively think about where any of the letters are - your fingers should know where to go automatically.|5.093321|3.64318|7.1809425
2240|White stones border the path. Two dogs are following an old woman in gardening clothes as she strolls along. She is in the middle distance, small beneath the trees, beneath the snowy peaks. It is winter. All the elms are bare. The scene is both stark and comforting. This path leads toward one edge of the camp, but the wire is out of sight, or out of focus. The tiny woman very much seems at ease. She and her tiny dogs seemed swallowed by the landscape, or floating in it.|5.455082|4.1477547|6.6455526

1568|So here's another day I spend away from you. Another night I'm on another broken avenue. My bag is ripped and worn, then again, now so am I. Take what you want to take, what you want to take, what you... I miss the stupid things, we go to sleep and then you wake me up and kick me out of bed at 3 AM. Pick up the phone and hear you saying things to me, do what you want to do, what you want to do, what you. Take me with you, I start to miss you. Take me home, I don't want to be alone tonight.

130|It's a queer thing, growing up. The years pile up, Hap, but at the same time I'm still ever age I ever was. When we stood before those sea-giants, I felt five years old, awed and scared. When I see a pretty lady, I'm eighteen again! And when my bones remind me, I feel all of my sixty years. All those ages are still inside me, all at once. The years stack up like sediment, and the layers remain.|5.323887|5.029252|6.158134
169|Well, then, here we are. A little challenge for you all as you embark on your separate doctoral journeys, whatever they may be, Mr. Hawking.

Yeah I'm sinking in the quicksand of a place I once called home, that's growing everyday but I've never felt more alone. Well you went out on your own, I wonder if you feel the same.

1636|Well, thank you, Big Baby. Why don't you come meet our new friends? Poor baby. We were thrown out together, me and him. Abandoned by the same owner. But we don't need owners at Sunnyside. We own ourselves. We're masters of our own fate. We control our own destiny.|6.570423|5.8910522|4.867855
1619|I gotta say what's on my mind. Somethin' about us doesn't seem right these days. Life keeps getting in the way. Whenever we try, somehow, the plan is always rearranged. It's so hard to say, but I gotta do what's best for me. You'll be okay. I've got to move on and be who I am. I just don't belong here, I hope you understand. We might find a place in this world someday. But at least for now, I gotta go my own way.|5.5052013|4.625406|6.29267
1869|There was a swirling mass of water that lived in a quiet pond. It asked permission from its master, to visit the lands beyond. And its master allowed it to fly. So the wind swept the whirlpool across the sky. The whirlpool's mother wore a jacket she'd sewn out of dental floss. It was stolen by a monkey, that sold it to an albatross. And it had the idea to fly. So the wind swept the whirlpool across the sky.|6.034567|4.1789904|6.2512817
2151|What happens to a dream deferred? Does it dry up like a raisin in the sun? Or fester like a sore- and then run? Does it stink like rotten meat? Or crust over- like a syrupy sweet? Maybe it just sags like a heavy load. Or does it... explode?|6.4173737|6.5326934|4.552923
1299|Hey, you're making yourselves look like fools. Let's be honest, boys. You're never gonna be real scarers. Because real scarers look like us. But hey, if you really want to work for a scare company, they're always... hiring in the mailroom.|7.878483|5.1457953|4.539135
1105|One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked.|5.8051205|3.8064873|6.612719
2173|I told you that if you hadn't lost your head I'd have made you go read to her. I wanted you to see something about her - I wanted you to see what real courage is, instead of getting the idea that courage is a man with a gun in his hand. It's when you know you're licked before you begin but you begin anyway and you see it through no matter what. You rarely win, but sometimes you do. Mrs. Dubose won, all ninety-eight pounds of her. According to her views, she died beholden to nothing and nobody. She was the bravest person I ever knew.|4.798517|4.221919|6.9509296
1892|After the nightmares, weak is our mind. It could be the devil hiding inside everyone. Throughout these visions, it's reality, but now it makes me wonder should I carry on my way. So close to the edge, black is the night. From here to madness there's only a short step to die. Lost in the trouble, eternally I am crawling in the fire and reaching eternity. Far away beyond the sky. I come alive again screaming in the wild, resound everywhere.|5.817297|4.023859|6.460992
2195|I think he knows I'm alive, having come down the tree steps of the back porch and given me a good once over. All afternoon he's been moving back and forth, gathering odd bits of walnut shells and twigs, while all about him the great fields tumble to the blades of the thresher. He's lucky to be where he is, wild with all that happens. He's lucky he's not one of the shadows living in the blond heart of the wheat. The autumn when trees bolt, dark with the fires of starlight, he'll curl among their roots, wanting nothing but the slow burn of matter on which he fastens like a small, brown flame.|5.157814|3.5113354|7.1710744

2192|I'm guessin' that if we can make some wishes out of airplanes, then maybe, oh maybe, I'll go back to the days before the politics that we call the rap game, and back when ain't nobody listened to my mixtape. So can I get a wish to end the politics, and get back to the music that started this...?

1304|That stuff would've informed you that this particular child is afraid of snakes, so a roar wouldn't make him scream, it would make him cry.

Good day.|6.208555|4.815292|5.71504
2256|I used to rule the world: seas would rise when I gave the word. Now in the morning, I sleep alone - sweep the streets I used to own. I used to roll the dice - feel the fear in my enemy's eyes. Listen as the crowd would sing, "Now the old King is dead, long live the King." One minute I held the key; next the walls were closed on me - and I discovered that my castles stand upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand.|4.1455746|5.8684907|6.2858405
2335|In the early and middle stages of any quest, there is often a Valley of Disappointment. You expect to make progress in a linear fashion and it's frustrating how ineffective changes can seem during first days, weeks, and even months. It doesn't feel like you are going anywhere. It's a hallmark of any compounding process: the most powerful outcomes are delayed.|6.6131897|4.1501684|5.873469
1991|What matter? We will build another windmill. We will build six windmills if we feel like it. You do not appreciate, comrade, the mighty thing that we have done.

1116|It is a law of nature we overlook, that intellectual versatility is the compensation for change, danger, and trouble. An animal perfectly in harmony with its environment is a perfect mechanism. Nature never appeals to intelligence until habit and instinct are useless. There is no intelligence where there is no change and no need of change.

2129|Many animals, such as eagles, hawks, owls, foxes, bobcats, and coyotes, like to eat rabbits and hares. This means they must always be alert for danger.

Life goes by in the blink of an eye, with so much left to say. These were the best of times, I'll miss these days. Your spirit lit my life each day. Thank you for the inspiration.

126|This neighborhood is a lifeboat in a storm we can't stop. Only so many people can be in our boat, no matter how many swimmers you see bobbing about in the ocean. If you try to pull in too many, you sink. You save nobody, including those who were in the boat. Our priority has to be those who are in the boat, because we can't save all of those who need to be in the boat.

261|The man that I named the Giver passed along to the boy knowledge, history, memories, color, pain, laughter, love, and truth. Every time you place a book in the hands of a child, you do the same thing. It is very risky. But each time a child opens a book, he pushes open the gate that separates him from Elsewhere. It gives him choices. It gives him freedom. Those are magnificent, wonderfully unsafe things.|5.5557766|4.496789|6.230213

Since you didn't wanna give me your math, I thought that you were iggin' me, and wasn't diggin' me. But anyway, what you doing tonight? I'll probably be with my peeps.

2063|An earthquake is a perceptible shaking of the surface of the Earth which can be violent enough to destroy major buildings and kill thousands of people.

I see the kids in the street, with not enough to eat. Who am I to be blind, pretending not to see their needs. A summer's disregard, a broken bottle top, and a one man's soul.

1838|An exquisite pleasure had invaded my senses, but individual, detached, with no suggestion of its origin. And at once the vicissitudes of life had become indifferent to me, its disasters innocuous, its brevity illusory, this new sensation having had on me the effect which love has of filling me with a precious essence; or rather this essence was not in me, it was myself. I had ceased now to feel mediocre, contingent, mortal.|6.68108|3.0675273|6.36602

944|If men learn this, it will implant forgetfulness in their souls; they will cease to exercise memory because they rely on that which is written, calling things to remembrance no longer from within themselves, but by means of external marks. What you have discovered is a recipe not for memory, but for reminder. And it is no true wisdom that you offer your disciples, but only its semblance, for by telling them of many things without teaching them you will make them seem to know much, while for the most part they know nothing, and as men filled, not with wisdom, but with the conceit of wisdom, they will be a burden to their fellows.|5.287216|2.8870926|7.2905846

1565|Thank you, Walt. If anyone ever got hold of anchovy DNA, they could chop out the oil-making gene, stick it in a bunch of 3rd world kids, and bam! Cheap effective robot oil. Enough to put dear old mom out of business.|7.2865677|5.8309364|4.2063255

2374|Type 1a supernovae are thought to be potentially the most dangerous if they occur close enough to the Earth. Because these supernovae arise from dim, common white dwarf stars in binary systems, it is likely that a supernova that can affect the Earth will occur unpredictably and in a star system that is not well studied.|7.4315243|3.5978644|5.505289
2087|So the question remains: why do we still use QWERTY? There is no reason, aside from the fact that it came first. It was already the standard when computer keyboards came into prominence, and now that it's so widespread, it would be an extremely difficult task to alter that standard.|6.4792595|5.1665535|5.096637
2175|Somehow everything was different, like a new person had emerged from me; I could see myself in a perspective that I've never seen before: no ambitions, no worries. For the first time I felt like I knew where I belonged and nothing could stop me from being there. Nothing and yet everything felt real. The world was underneath me, around me, above me; I could see everything and everything could see me. I found... Peace.|5.128605|4.497341|6.319716
18|Your biggest concern while in this realm will likely be the Nyctofly. This airborne insect lives in heavily wooded areas and can locate you from far away. When you hear its wings fluttering, you know that it's time to fight. It's much harder to fight in open areas, so it's advised to stay in a tight space.|7.282522|3.958401|5.361894
1664|Even if we fell down on the ground, we strongly believe light lights up our feet. Keep going to win, never lose our faith. We are the force of courage. Even if we fell down on the ground, we only believe we can see the rising sun. Keep going to win, never lose our faith until the end. Pray to the edge of the sky. We go to where no one could ever see. Pray to the edge of the sky. Surely we carry out promise with you. Until the end we will keep fighting for you until the end I will stand there for you. And we will stand on the promised land, we'll raise our swords, and raise our flag.|4.118|4.140632|7.1441746
1666|As sworn allies, we fight, never been apart. Winning is the only way for us to live. Those of who lost their lives live in our minds. Everything I have seen still not the past. Grieving rain of tears. Just falling on me. Piercing my heart; it flows to the sea. Grieving rain of blood. Just wearing for me. Dyeing my soul, and it flows to the sea.|5.619972|4.920064|5.742242

1431|Brothers. Does every sister have to deal with this? No. Do I have to deal with this? Of course. You'd think I'd have better things to do and more important things to worry about. Every single day it's one thing after another. But do Mom and Dad see it? No. Do they get in trouble? No. And another thing...|4.5780773|6.528546|5.340747
1803|Remember before when I was talking about smelly garbage standing around being useless? That was a metaphor. I was actually talking about you. And I'm sorry. You didn't react at the time, so I was worried it sailed right over your head. Which would have made this apology seem insane. That's why I had to call you garbage a second time just now.|6.122957|4.4131455|5.724144
1092|Rather than offer you the illusion of free choice, I will take the liberty of choosing for you... if and when your time comes round again.

1602|Come on, there's something I need to show you. I've wanted to bring you here from the moment you opened your eyes. This is a sacred place. The place of chiefs. There will come a time when you will stand on this peak and place a stone on this mountain. Like I did. Like my father did. And his father and every chief there has ever been. And on that day, when you place your stone, you will raise this whole island higher. You are the future of our people, Moana. They are not out there. They are right here.

I don't know where this road is going to lead. All I know is where we've been and what we've been through. If we get to see tomorrow I hope it's worth all the wait.

1646|Research in psychology has revealed that our decisions are disrupted by an array of biases and irrationalities: We're overconfident. We seek out information that supports us and downplay information that doesn't. We get distracted by short-term emotions.|7.6841507|4.417034|4.7402897
1731|What if you knew this is not the way things are supposed to be? I'm not like that. I'm not into the whole "destiny, there's-only-one-right-way" thing. I'm not either, but what's worse? Thinking you're being paranoid or knowing you should be?|5.111784|7.173475|4.5666566

105|Ever since the dawn of civilization, people have not been content to see events as unconnected and inexplicable. They have craved an understanding of the underlying order in the world. Today we still yearn to know why we are here and where we came from. Humanity's deepest desire for knowledge is justification enough for our continuing quest.

1074|Security, like backing up, is one of those topics that we all should probably take more seriously than we do. Whenever reports are released highlighting popular password selections, it's clear that not everyone is on the same page, or even reading from the same book.

1736|Continuation lines should align wrapped elements either vertically using Python's implicit line joining inside parentheses, brackets and braces, or using a hanging indent.

You are sealed into one of the thirty-two capsules with the strangers who were next to you in the queue, and when they close the doors, the sound of the city is cut off. You begin to rise. The capsules are made of glass and steel and are hung from the rim of the wheel. As the wheel turns, the capsules use the force of gravity to stay upright.

124|It'd be like looking for a needle in a burning haystack. Oh, I've done that, Mark said airily. It's a game we used to play, after we got rid of all our livestock and didn't need our hay no more.

You keep telling me that your time is always taken. But I keep seeing you out alone. Listen to love, your heart is pounding with desire, waiting to be unleashed. Quit breakin' my heart.|5.585314|4.597611|5.8132067

Every turn I take, every trail I track, every path I make, every road leads back, to the place I know where I cannot go, where I long to be. See the line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me. And no one knows, how far it goes. If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me, one day I'll know. If I go there's just no telling how far I'll go.|4.033453|4.2459416|6.9509296
83|While Dorothy was looking earnestly into the queer, painted face of the Scarecrow, she was surprised to see one of the eyes slowly wink at her. She thought she must have been mistaken, at first, for none of the scarecrows in Kansas ever wink; but presently the figure nodded its head to her in a friendly way. Then she climbed down from the fence and walked up to it, while Toto ran around the pole and barked.|5.476116|3.978993|6.2512817

1240|Man is a strange creature. All his actions are motivated by desire, his character forged by pain. As much as he may try to suppress that pain, to repress the desire, he cannot free himself from the eternal servitude to his feelings. For as long as the storm rages within him, he cannot find peace. Not in life, not in death. And so he will do what he must, day in, day out. The pain is his vessel, desire his compass. It is all that man is capable of.|4.81913|4.1436987|6.5153036

1673|Proud enough for you to call me arrogant, greedy enough to be labeled a thief. Angry enough for me to go and hurt a man, cruel enough for me to feel no grief. Never could have just a part of it, I always need more to get by. Getting right down to the heart of it, the root of all evil has been running my whole life. Dirty enough for me to lust, leaving nothing left to trust, jealous enough to still feel envious. Lazy enough to sleep all day and let my life just waste away, selfish enough to make you wait for me.|4.8803635|3.532735|6.854629

405|But now, for the first time, I see you are a man like me. I thought of your hand-grenades, of your bayonet, of your rifle; now I see your wife and your face and our fellowship. Forgive me, comrade. We always see it too late. Why do they never tell us that you are poor devils like us, that your mothers are just as anxious as ours, that we have the same fear of death, and the same dying and the same agony - Forgive me, comrade; how could you be my enemy?|4.560074|4.3244796|6.544645
1865|If you could save yourself, you'd save us all. Is that what you called me for, is that why you're knocking on my door? The time I've spent, working myself to death. Thought that's what you wanted. I thought you needed my help. To make it good again, to make us strong. To make you happy, to push you along. And gain some respect, to be thrown a crumb.

'For one thing it would take a long while: my name is growing all the time, and I've lived a very long, long time; so my name is like a story.

1107|A long, long time ago, I can still remember how that music used to make me smile. And I knew if I had my chance that I could make those people dance, and maybe they'd be happy for a while. But February made me shiver, with every paper I'd deliver. Bad news on the doorstep, I couldn't take one more step.

My little horse must think it queer to stop without a farmhouse near between the woods and frozen lake the darkest evening of the year. He gives his harness bells a shake to ask if there is some mistake. The only other sound's the sweep of easy wind and downy flake.

It's not our fault - it's how currents flow. Even though it's hard to know you are leaving this picture, you remain another memory of summer when we loved.

2050|Maybe we all have in us a secret pond where evil and ugly things germinate and grow strong. But this culture is fenced, and the swimming brood climbs up only to fall back. Might it not be that in the dark pools of some men the evil grows strong enough to wriggle over the fence and swim free?

There is the sensitive creative sort who loves the feel of the rain on the face, like it was a washing away of all negative thoughts.

2350|The chamber of the stone god statue might have been massive, yet its actual inner structure was on the simpler side. On the walls, countless torches could be found there.

162|If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue, or walk with kings - nor lose the common touch, if neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you, if all men count with you, but none too much; if you can fill the unforgiving minute with sixty seconds' worth of distance run, yours is the earth and everything that's in it, and - which is more - you'll be a man, my son!|4.958397|4.0771255|5.9403095

129|After graduating from our school, they went into the Woods expecting epic battles with monsters and wizards, only to find their fairy tales unfold right in their own houses.

We're just so bound to make mistakes, you could call it a disposition, I apologize for all your tears, I wish I could be different. But I'm still growing up, into the one you can call your love.

1928|Any animal caught singing it was given a flogging on the spot. And yet the song was irrepressible. The blackbirds whistled it in the hedges, the pigeons cooed it in the elms, it got into the din of the smithies and the tune of the church bells. And when the human beings listened to it, they secretly trembled, hearing in it a prophecy of their future doom.|5.7603645|3.4480975|5.83924

2163|This is part of what a family is about, not just love, but letting others know there's someone who is watching out for them. It's what I missed so much when my mother died - what I call your 'spiritual security' - knowing that your family will be there watching out for you. Nothing else will give you that. Not money. Not fame.|5.065485|4.498027|5.5740366
223|Money is defined in terms of what it does: money is any asset that can easily be used to purchase goods and services. For ease of use, money must be widely accepted by sellers.

2390|The best way to measure how much you've grown isn't by inches or the number of laps you can now run around the track, or even your grade point average-- though those things are important, to be sure. It's what you've done with your time, how you've chosen to spend your days, and whom you've touched this year. That, to me, is the greatest measure of success.|4.950657|4.122179|5.8564224

389|A story is like a giant jigsaw puzzle, a jigsaw puzzle that would cover the whole floor of a room with its tiny pieces. But it's not the sort of puzzle that comes with a box. There is no lid with a picture on it so that you can see what the puzzle will look like when it's finished. And you have only some of the pieces. All you can do is keep looking and listening, sniffing about in all sorts of places, until you find the next piece.|4.6270065|3.4802964|6.423684

2083|With this faith, we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith, we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood.

1850|Often people have it wrong, mistakenly believing that showing mercy to an enemy is kindness. They spare the foe whose life is in their hands. But don't you see? It's an empty existence, to go on living, alone and unloved, when defeat's already cost you your dream!|6.125868|4.4418907|4.867855

1616|It's hard to believe that I couldn't see, you were always there beside me. Thought I was alone, with no one to hold, but you were always right beside me. This feeling's like no other. I want you to know, I never had someone, that knows me like you do, the way you do. I've never had someone, as good for me as you, no one like you. So lonely before, I finally found, what I've been looking for.|4.048603|4.2132106|6.135943

2126|When the gray skies take the colors away, I'll paint a rainbow lasting for days and days just like the magic that you always shared with me. Maybe now you need to believe.

1579|That diet and exercise regimen your mother put me on has really changed my life. It's nice having her home more. She wakes up cheerful every morning, leaves little love notes in my briefcase, calls me up at work just to chat. That woman must be stopped!|6.465002|4.121735|4.727251
896|Gary now I know I was wrong, I messed up, and now you're gone. Gary I'm sorry I neglected you, oh I never expected you to run away and leave me feeling this empty.

1269|You are my fire, the one desire. Believe when I say, I want it that way. But we are two worlds apart. Can't reach to your heart, when you say, that I want it that way.

140|I've spent a lifetime practicing, becoming who I must be to survive. Hiding in plain sight, always acting, always playing a part. There are times when I fear that I'll lose me, my true self, in the haze of the facade. But that fear doesn't matter to anyone besides myself.|5.848295|4.297706|4.9663033
1335|For Pete's sake, are you that cold? Look into your heart. Now we've got a choice: either you and I work all night to find a certain lost daughter or you can leave now. But if you leave now, that little football-headed kid will never believe in miracles again.|5.485958|4.903906|4.804709
1040|Military preparations must be preceded by so many tedious discussions, arising from the jealousies, pride, separate views, and clashing pretensions of sovereign bodies, that before the diet can settle the arrangements, the enemy are in the field; and before the federal troops are ready to take it, are retiring into winter quarters.|6.2686977|2.8343525|5.6219788

2135|Here is what to do with hot tips. If you get a hot tip, make a note of it and pretend to be very interested. But don't buy. If the thing takes off, listen a little more closely the next time this fellow has a tip. If it gets mauled, look bitter the next time you see him.

832|I love you all the same, it's just a situation. Don't let it get between what we want, yeah, what we could be. I love you more each day. Sometimes I can't explain it but I feel it and I don't want that to change. I'm just dreaming, I know you're thinking, that the summer left us behind.

1606|Yeah, it almost sounds like you don't like me, which is impossible because I got stuck here for a thousand years, trying to get the heart as a gift for you mortals so you could have the power to create life itself.

1920|In the end they finished the harvest in two days less time than it had usually taken Jones and his men. Moreover, it was the biggest harvest that the farm had ever seen.

1967|But we were all wrong, comrades. Do you know what the real reason was? Snowball was in league with Jones from the very start! He was Jones's secret agent all the time.

2154|Once, he brought a tango tape and got them to play it over the speakers. Then he commandeered the floor, shooting back and forth like some hot Latin lover. When he finished, everyone applauded. He could have stayed in that moment forever.|6.429327|4.2777243|4.5252914
1372|It's finally ready! You know, I went through quite a few supers to get it worthy to fight you, but man, it wasn't good enough!

419|Man is the only creature that consumes without producing. He does not give milk, he does not lay eggs, he is too weak to pull the plough, he cannot run fast enough to catch rabbits.

1749|Haskell is statically typed. When you compile your program, the compiler knows which piece of code is a number, which is a string and so on.

1598|Most people only live for their image, that is why where some have a self, a starting point, most people have a void, because they are so busy projecting themselves as this or that, dedicating their lives to actualize a concept of what they should be like rather than to actualize their ever-growing potentiality as a human being.|5.4532776|2.9818585|5.5933285
1050|The relative execution times of instructions on a machine are usually discussed in clocks rather than absolute fractions of a second; one good reason for this is that clock speeds for various models of the machine may increase as technology improves, and it is usually the relative times one is interested in when discussing the instruction set.|5.898554|2.3155596|5.7332106
443|In intercourse with scholars and artists one readily makes mistakes of opposite kinds: in a remarkable scholar one not infrequently finds a mediocre man; and often, even in a mediocre artist, one finds a very remarkable man.|7.2009487|3.3214855|4.3255663
1287|Names convey meanings; our choice of names determines the meaning of what we say. An inappropriate name gives people the wrong idea.

103|And as we wind on down the road, our shadows taller than our soul. There walks a lady we all know, who shines white light and wants to show how everything still turns to gold. And if you listen very hard, the tune will come to you at last. When all are one and one is all, to be a rock and not to roll. And she's buying a stairway to heaven.|4.34585|3.8398037|5.696724
2164|We laughed, and Morrie laughed, too, as hard as he could, with his limited breathing. It was the first time in weeks that I could recall him telling a story like this.

2099|If you're just looking for raw speed, then do all the practice that you can and analyze yourself for areas of improvement.

282|But all we said, not a word could we drag out of him; I almost felt like pushing him over, so as to change his position, for it was almost intolerable, it seemed so painfully and unnaturally constrained; especially, as in all probability he had been sitting so for upwards of eight or ten hours, going too without his regular meals.|5.3539467|2.9746602|5.612467

440|There is, in fine, a gradation of rank in physical states, to which the gradation of rank in the problems corresponds; and the highest problems repel ruthlessly every one who ventures too near them, without being predestined for their solution by the loftiness and power of his spirituality.|6.2744427|2.7529843|5.1878943

1556|I struggled to survive in the mortal world since I came to life and joined this world.

2179|We do not propose to say that there shall be no rich men. We do not ask to divide the wealth.

1931|There was not an animal on the farm that did not take vengeance on them after his own fashion.

962|Every day I'm here, I think: Why did it ever come to this? Damaged minds and bodies, their freedom taken away. Even losing themselves. If people knew it would come to this, nobody would go to war.|5.3122807|5.391633|3.891017
1280|All teenagers are hackers. They have to be, if only because their life circumstances are untenable. They think they're adults, but the adults think they're kids.|7.463011|4.3054876|3.2748642
1560|Destiny has cheated me by forcing me to decide upon, the woman that I idolize, or the hands of an automaton. Without these hands I can't complete the opera that was captivating her, but if I keep them, and she marries him, then he probably won't want me dating her.|5.7929897|3.3264935|4.880334
1120|I am nothing special, of this I am sure. I am a common man with common thoughts and I've led a common life. There are no monuments dedicated to me and my name will soon be forgotten, but I've loved another with all my heart and soul, and to me, this has always been enough...|4.408764|4.4582467|5.0024185
913|I don't wanna see you cry. You don't have to feel this emptiness. She said I love you till the day that I die. Well maybe she's right 'cause I don't wanna feel like I'm not me. And to be honest I don't even know why I let myself get down in the first place.|4.606737|4.6249824|4.7790956
2028|The sea is emotion incarnate. It loves, hates, and weeps. It defies all attempts to capture it with words and rejects all shackles. No matter what you say about it, there is always that which you can't.|6.22958|4.330183|3.9882665
1057|Although this process has met with opposition from some of the editors on the grounds that imperfect work may leave their offices, the advantages in making this material available as a research tool outweigh fears about the misspelling of proper names and other relatively minor editorial matters.|6.3747272|2.1316712|5.25445
2328|Maybe there are people who can achieve incredible success overnight but I don't know any of them. It is a gradual evolution, a long series of small wins and tiny breakthroughs. The only way we make progress is to start small.|6.3456154|3.6251216|4.340206
1987|Two of the men had produced a crowbar and a sledge hammer. They were going to knock the windmill down. 'Impossible!' cried Napoleon.|6.7004147|5.920768|2.6949196
1039|If a pertinacious minority can control the opinion of a majority, respecting the best mode of conducting it, the majority, in order that something may be done, must conform to the views of the minority; and thus the sense of the smaller number will overrule that of the greater, and give a tone to the national proceedings.|5.301468|2.7199054|5.5251274
1906|Man serves the interests of no creature except himself. And among us animals let there be perfect unity, perfect comradeship in the struggle. All men are enemies. All enemies are comrades.|6.6495132|4.2588906|3.7576742
1915|For the first few minutes the animals could hardly believe in their good fortune. The first act was to gallop in a body right around the boundaries of the farm, as though to make quite sure that no human being was hiding anywhere upon it; then they raced back to the farm buildings to wipe out the last traces of Jones' hated reign.|4.6318493|3.2232757|5.612467
1627|Alright, come here. Come on. Let me see that. Oh, it's just a popped seam. Easily repaired. You should consider yourself lucky.|6.8413677|5.952343|2.587966
1821|You know what I have too many of around here? Monitors. I was just thinking earlier today I wish I had fewer monitors that were working. So you're actually helping me by smashing them.|6.7950706|4.2261114|3.6893883
1719|Compromise where you can. Where you can't, don't. Even if everyone is telling you that something wrong is something right. Even if the whole world is telling you to move, it is your duty to plant yourself like a tree, look them in the eye, and say: No, you move.|4.5376396|4.5454473|4.8427477
938|Whatever made me the way I am left me hollow, empty inside, unable to feel. It doesn't seem like a big deal. I'm quite sure most people fake an awful lot of everyday human contact. I just fake it all. I fake it very well, and the feelings are never there.|5.490692|3.7700188|4.753277
915|Fear is a strange soil. It grows obedience like corn, which grow in straight lines to make weeding easier. But sometimes it grows the potatoes of defiance, which flourish underground.|7.1186485|3.937451|3.6721458
400|Do you smell it? That smell. A kind of smelly smell. The smelly smell that smells... smelly.|7.5564537|6.5582724|1.7764173
1561|I've modded the device to release a single huge antichroniton blast. It should rip us out of stasis back to the instant before I conceived of the Time Button.|7.374216|4.4158254|3.2179356
446|Cynicism is the only form in which base souls approach what is called honesty; and the higher man must open his ears to all the coarser or finer cynicism, and congratulate himself when the clown becomes shameless right before him, or the scientific satyr speaks out.|6.3877125|2.6692424|4.8927627
1023|You stress over money and your career, you set your clocks back, you exercise, you wait in line, you paint your house, get depressed, feel better, buy things, take your clothes to the dry cleaner, set your clocks forward and spend your whole life waiting for happiness to arrive in the mail.|5.637966|2.9151633|5.1878943
726|After so much careful work, it does seem as if not one pen out of a thousand could be faulty; but every one has to be carefully examined to make sure that the cutting, piercing, marking, forming, tempering, grinding, and slitting, are just what they should be.|5.946003|3.2060761|4.817439
7|If I disobey that fat old fool K. Rool, it's the big sawmill in the sky for me, so pay up pronto and I can get my wooden butt outta here!|7.7020187|4.7553215|2.7997599
1049|I have often felt that programming is an art form, whose real value can only be appreciated by another versed in the same arcane art; there are lovely gems and brilliant coups hidden from human view and admiration, sometimes forever, by the very nature of the process.|6.2459984|2.755511|4.917472
1464|I was lucky enough to have a friend. A friend who dragged me out of the darkness and showed me I was wrong. He put every emotion he had right into his Beyblade, and he used every bit of that strength to show me exactly what true strength was, and true resonance.|5.6822586|3.4109478|4.8427477
1471|If you leave your game, stay safe, stay alert, and whatever you do, don't die! Because if you die outside your own game, you don't regenerate, ever! Game over.|6.5487003|5.1501074|3.2369876
2003|They accepted everything that they were told about the Rebellion and the principles of Animalism, especially from Clover, for whom they had an almost filial respect; but it was doubtful whether they understood much of it.|5.941511|4.0552354|4.2812967
139|You don't cry when someone pushes you down. You get up. You get up and you fight back. And pretty soon nobody's going to shove you anymore because they'll see it's not worth it.|6.596739|4.5651755|3.567233
1423|Perry the Platypus! Oh, your persistence is insufferable. And by that, I mean completely sufferable.|7.95434|5.817586|1.9720345
1055|Many introverted hackers who are next to inarticulate in person communicate with considerable fluency over the net, perhaps precisely because they can forget on an unconscious level that they are dealing with people and thus don't feel stressed and anxious as they would face to face.|6.3844814|2.289245|5.1082044
156|It bothered him a little to lie about small things. But he always had; he had grown up lying, and he still found it strange that the people in this place where he now lived thought lying was wrong. To Matty, it was sometimes a way of making things easier, more comfortable, more convenient.|4.6430264|3.8518815|5.176646
523|Being kept awake one night by a toothache, some thoughts undesignedly came into his head concerning the roulette or cycloid; one idea followed another; and he thus discovered properties of this curve even to demonstration.|6.9157524|3.0677485|4.296112
1797|You should now feel mentally reinvigorated. If you suspect staring at art has not provided the required intellectual sustenance, reflect briefly on this classical music.|8.001852|3.421419|3.4233828
2091|Overwriting the habits and techniques that I use to type each word is actually pretty mentally taxing: suddenly, you have to think about every single key that you press and resist your muscle memory's inclination to hit a different key.|6.65419|2.9936163|4.4974384
1960|We will teach this miserable traitor that he cannot undo our work so easily. Remember comrades, there must be no alteration in our plans: they shall be carried out to the day. Forward, comrades!|6.1476955|4.4629507|3.8580794
1322|I know I'm going to regret saying this, but you may have finally achieved "so dumb it just might work."|5.662468|7.8412433|2.043795

1685|This clearly went too far, since most disputes are not about points of logic but about points of fact, and anyway not even all logical truths can be proved mathematically in the way Leibniz envisaged.|7.2870026|3.198519|3.9561086
2376|I hate being clever, thought the captain, when you don't really feel clever and don't want to be clever. To sneak around and make plans and feel big about making them. I hate this feeling of thinking I'm doing right when I'm not really certain I am.|5.214924|4.0389|4.674572
158|Perhaps simple to be known, to be looked upon by so many people, to be the focal point of so many concentrating eyes, perhaps this was enough to make one different; enough to transform one into something else, someone else; just as by becoming an increasingly larger boy one became one day a man.|5.36989|2.9710839|5.243468
149|Some things you just can't explain. You don't even try. You don't know where to start. All your sentences would jumble up like a giant knot if you opened your mouth. Any words you used would come out wrong.|5.674017|4.5881996|4.051818
1165|It's a rare day when she speaks in anything but platitudes - all those exhausted phrases and hand-me-down ideas that cram the dump sites of contemporary wisdom.|6.8262177|4.7533393|3.2559638
1063|Whether that data is raw in nature, such as names, addresses and phone numbers, or it consists of secret governmental strategies and policies or proprietary business details, information is the key building block upon which modern society functions.|6.653681|2.6381764|4.674572
1916|Then they made a tour of inspection of the whole farm and surveyed with speechless admiration the ploughland, the hayfield, the orchard, the pool, the spinney. It was as though they had never seen these things before, and even now they could hardly believe that it was all their own.|5.456167|3.0991926|5.096637
1639|You shouldn't have come back, cowboy. They've cracked down hard since you left. More guards, more patrols. You and your friends ain't ever getting out of here now.|6.6796684|4.784844|3.31244
540|Thus the law of what logicians term simple conversion, is determined by the fact, that the corresponding equations are symmetrical, that they are unaffected by a mutual change of place, in those symbols which correspond to the convertible classes.|6.667799|2.6467004|4.6479154
1475|But do not name it, my friend, for it is like water. Nothing is softer than water, yet it can overcome rock. It does not fight. It flows around the opponent, formless, nameless.|6.4043427|4.629707|3.567233
2059|Free to elect who we want. Free to live how we want, and most importantly, free to go wherever we want without the confine of those huge black walls. So with that in mind, I would like to thank everyone for coming to this wonderful event. Let the festival begin.|5.0883865|3.845994|4.8427477
388|You can't write a story until you've felt it. Breathed it in. Walked with your characters. Talked with them. That's why you've come here. To live your story.|6.0878315|5.5239244|3.1988072
1640|You can unlock doors, sneak past guards, climb the wall, but if you don't take out that monkey, you ain't going nowhere. You wanna get out of here? Get rid of that monkey!|6.300289|4.882532|3.4597774
2347|There must've been some sort of mechanism installed on the heavy-looking door, since the physical strength of a 67-year-old man was enough to easily open it.|6.234934|5.3543215|3.1988072
1234|Research shows that there is only half as much variation in student achievement between schools as there is among classrooms in the same school. If you want your child to get the best education possible, it is actually more important to get him assigned to a great teacher than to a great school.|5.543207|2.734288|5.243468
2330|It is so easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis. Too often, we convince ourselves that massive success requires massive action but it's simply not true.|6.247774|3.0329185|4.634507
1709|If a physician of high standing, and one's own husband, assures friends and relatives that there is really nothing the matter with one but temporary nervous depression - a slight hysterical tendency - what is one to do?|5.7445354|4.1319156|4.2514877
417|My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all. The morning rain clouds up my window, and I can't see at all. And even if I could it'll all be gray, but your picture on my wall. It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad.|4.6670303|4.5766006|4.621045
1936|A thought struck Clover. Without saying anything to the others she went to Mollie's stall and turned over the straw with her hoof. Hidden under the straw was a little pile of lump sugar and several bunches of ribbon of different colours.|5.3194427|4.1194897|4.5113926
1683|The trial of Socrates took place in 399 BC when he was nearly seventy. The charges were that he refused to recognize the official gods of the state, that he introduced new gods and that he corrupted the young.|5.1635647|4.92662|4.0988193
788|Some old people keep young at heart in spite of wrinkles and gray hairs, can sympathize with children's little cares and joys, make them feel at home, and can hide wise lessons under pleasant plays, giving and receiving friendship in the sweetest way.|6.429384|2.73194|4.7010164
61|You're so afraid of losing the people that you love that you push them away. And that's why you'll always be an orphan. You don't need some villain swooping in to destroy your happiness. You do that quite well all on your own.|5.535467|4.1400294|4.354787
1727|Everything we're putting in that box comes ungrounded. And I don't mean grounded to the earth, I mean not tethered. We're blocking whatever keeps it moving forward, so they flip-flop.|6.1569653|4.6307535|3.6721458
1053|Since users always want to be able to do everything but never want to suffer for any mistakes, the construction of a firewall is a question not only of defensive coding but also of interface presentation, so that users don't even get curious about those corners of a system where they can burn themselves.|5.758623|2.3321724|5.340747
922|You're just too good to be true, can't take my eyes off of you. You'll be like heaven to touch, I wanna hold you so much. At long last, love has arrived and I thank God, I'm alive. You're just too good to be true, can't take my eyes off of you.|4.3632812|4.854144|4.607529
1996|The animals sniffed the air hungrily and wondered whether a warm mash was being prepared for their supper. But no warm mash appeared, and on the following Sunday it was announced that from onwards all barley would be reserved for the pigs.|5.9922523|3.392606|4.539135
2389|I need you more than you know, more than you'd believe. You're the only thing that really makes me want to live. There are times when I feel like I have no will to fight. You always come and chase the demons from my mind. You're beautiful inside and out, and I wish to thank you, for you're the one who made me want to stay.|3.6942139|4.0072484|5.5349874
1377|What do you think is going on here? You think we're on vacation or something? Mom and Dad's lives could be in jeopardy. Or worse, their marriage.|6.2096596|5.7024355|2.963212
2346|Treasures or rare loot found in a dungeon would normally be divided equally among all the participants in a raid. It was quite a different way of sharing the rewards where one could take possession of magic crystals one procured by themselves.|6.4304333|2.8655868|4.5939593
1694|Listen to me, mister. You're my knight in shining armor. Don't you forget it. You're going to get back on that horse, and I'm going to be right behind you, holding on tight, and away we're gonna go, go, go!|4.967266|5.1477537|4.051818
118|Our purpose on this earth is not one single event, an accomplishment we can check off a list. There is no test. No passing or failing. There's only us, each moment shaping who we are, into what we will become.|5.788435|4.2715774|4.0988193
814|For quick development is of the utmost importance, and he who succeeds first in placing all his pieces, from their initial awkward positions, to such places as give them command of the greatest possible number of squares, has the better chance of concentrating a superior force on some important point.|5.6687527|2.4421978|5.308708
1454|Yeah, I got plenty. Disinfect the mask. You're going to want to use baby powder in the suit, heavy on the joints. You don't want any chafing, right?|6.577978|5.237023|3.0231729
410|The last big rains of the year were falling. It was the time for treading red earth with which to build walls. It was not done earlier because the rains were too heavy and would have washed away the heap of trodden earth; and it could not be done later because harvesting would soon set in, and after that the dry season.|4.480318|3.2670114|5.505289

1185|Limitations foster creativity. Tell an artist to paint anything, and he may struggle, but tell him to create something specific, in a set amount of time, for a certain audience, and these constraints might well push him to produce something he might never have come up with on his own.|5.2890472|3.0904748|5.119725
1952|From now onwards Animal Farm would engage in trade with the neighbouring farms: not, of course, for any commercial purpose but simply in order to obtain certain materials which were urgently necessary.|6.243599|4.0104795|3.97222
1243|It's a piece of cake to bake a pretty cake, if the way is hazy. You gotta do the cooking by the book, you know you can't be lazy! Never use a messy recipe, the cake will end up crazy. If you do the cooking by the book, then you'll have a cake!|4.586439|4.5916305|4.5939593
476|There were minor variations from one manufacturer to another, but most typewriters followed the concept that each key was attached to a typebar that had the corresponding letter molded, in reverse, into its striking head.|7.113409|2.6529171|4.2812967
1955|They would meet in the public houses to prove to one another by means of diagrams that the windmill was bound to fall down, or that if it did stand up, then that it would never work. And yet, against their will, they had developed a certain respect for the efficiency with which the animals were managing their own affairs.|4.8148346|2.8691323|5.5251274
2340|His wife was deeply worried about him since this would be his first raid in quite a while. Honestly, even he himself was worried, too. However, now that he listened to Kim's words, he felt like a weight was lifted off his mind.|5.4241734|4.132725|4.3693094
204|If it was an average pitcher, he would have given up long before, even so he wasn't bothered by his team's errors, continued to carry his team with relentless pitching. On his back... I feel like I saw a true ace.|5.5383396|4.35793|4.160619
1033|Of course, as we have seen, he was quite a simple man; indeed he might have passed for a boy again if he had been able to take his baldness off; but he had also a noble sense of justice and a lion's courage to do what seemed right to him; and having thought the matter out with anxious care after the flight of the children, he went down on all fours and crawled into the kennel.|3.9672108|2.8828983|6.020913
1964|Every night, it was said, he came creeping in under cover of darkness and performed all kinds of mischief. He stored the corn, he upset the milk-pails, he broke the eggs, he tramped the seed-beds, he gnawed the bark off the fruit trees.|5.040167|4.292188|4.4974384
125|True beauty is what lies inside of us, not what the world sees. A beautiful shell that houses a vile soul becomes sullied over time. But an outer shell, imperfect as it may be, that houses a beautiful soul shines with that beauty, radiating it for all who have eyes to see.|5.4175243|3.1441126|4.9783897
1745|The chain running through the locks sounded like the anchor of a galleon, and the door opened. Their pitiless guardian, the only creature who seemed alive in the instantaneous silence, began walking from one end of the dormitory to the other.|6.0766716|3.1382964|4.580335

1360|This is because I don't have powers, isn't it? Well not every superhero has powers, you know. You can be super without them. I invented these. I can fly. Can you fly?|5.853796|5.2924137|3.3682437

1392|The world is like a ride in an amusement park, and when you choose to go on it you think it's real because that's how powerful our minds are. The ride goes up and down, around and around, it has thrills and chills, and it's very brightly colored, and it's very loud, and it's fun for a while.|4.6990604|3.453994|5.199098

1032|He had hoped to fly, keeping not far from the ground so that nothing unwonted should escape his eyes; but in that fitful light to have flown low would have meant trailing his shadow through the trees, thus disturbing birds and acquainting a watchful foe that he was astir.|5.909931|2.6455326|4.9663033
